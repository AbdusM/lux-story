You hear the distant squeak of gurney wheels on waxed linoleum, the soft chime of elevator doors arriving. The hospitals of Birmingham, but also more - places where caring becomes as tangible as gauze and sutures."

How the scalpel feels like it weighs a thousand pounds, cold surgical steel warming slowly in your grip. I used to eat lunch at Al's Deli afterward, trying to forget what my hands had just done."

The air tastes of ozone and ambition, that particular flavor of late-night coding sessions fueled by Revelator Coffee. Birmingham's data heart beats here, each keystroke a tiny metallic click in the symphony of processing."

They chose Birmingham because it was rebuilding itself - they said a city that could transform from steel to medicine could transform them too. Now I'm supposed to be their American dream, but I keep thinking about Railroad Park, how they built something beautiful where furnaces used to burn. Maybe I don't have to be a doctor. Maybe I can build something new too."
