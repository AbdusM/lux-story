They chose Birmingham because it was rebuilding itself - they said a city that could transform from steel to medicine could transform them too. Now I'm supposed to be their American dream, but I keep thinking about Railroad Park, how they built something beautiful where furnaces used to burn. Maybe I don't have to be a doctor. Maybe I can build something new too."
