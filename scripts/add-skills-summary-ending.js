That's real jobs, real money. Respiratory therapy at Jeff State? Two years, then you're making $60K. Dental hygiene at UAB? Same deal.\n\nYou took your time with decisions. That's good. These programs want people who think things through, not rush into debt.\n\nYou helped Maya and Jordan when they were struggling.

Not tomorrow, now. That's free money you're leaving on the table.\n\nAlso, all these schools have free campus tours. Go. Ask about payment plans. Ask about work-study.
