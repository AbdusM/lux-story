  // Scene 2-3a2 - Maya's introduction
  "I failed a big test last week. First F ever. My parents said 'it's fine, try again.' But they don't know I was so stressed I threw up before the test. Been getting good grades for years, now I can't even focus. My hands shake when I try to study.":
    "I lost my job at Target last week. Couldn't afford to miss my shift when my little brother got sick, but somebody had to watch him. Mom works doubles at the hospital. Now I'm behind on my phone bill and my community college application fee is due next week. Everyone says 'just work harder' but I'm already doing homework at 2 AM after my other job.",
  
  // Maya's background
  "My parents moved here from Taiwan in '92. They chose Birmingham because of the medical programs":
    "My mom came here from Mexico when I was little. She chose Birmingham because her sister said there were jobs",
  
  // Maya's pressure
  "Everyone expects me to be a doctor. It's been the plan since I was five":
    "Everyone expects me to be the first to graduate college. But they don't get how expensive it is",
  
  // Maya's current situation
  "I'm taking a gap year to 'reassess.' Really I'm just scared":
    "I'm trying to save up for school while helping at home. It's harder than I thought",
  
  // Maya's doubts
  "What if I'm not smart enough? What if I wasted four years?":
    "What if I can't afford it? What if I pick the wrong major and waste the loans?",
  
  // Maya's family dynamics
  "My parents don't understand. They think I'm being dramatic":
    "My mom doesn't understand. She didn't go to college but thinks it's easy if you just study",
  
  // Maya's career thoughts
  "Maybe I should just go into nursing instead. It's faster":
    "Maybe I should just do the welding program at Jeff State. It pays good and it's only two years",
  
  // Maya's platform description
  "Platform 1 smells like antiseptic and ambition":
    "Platform 1 smells like coffee and early mornings",
