# Part 1: Library Event Debrief & Customer Discovery

**Ronny** [0:00]
Yeah, that's alright. So start with like what we see, the agenda, and try to like time box and things. There's very specific things from a product that we wanted to cover. So one you kind of frame that agenda, and I want to give feedback a little on that event from yesterday and a potential like lead for testing as well.

**Abdus** [0:40]
Like, 30 minutes to an hour. Oh, shit, actually, no, I should, yeah, definitely 30 minutes. Okay, all right, so have to add some money to the parking.

**Ronny** [0:55]
Give me five minute debrief on that event yesterday to see how it influences the rest of the conversation. So, you know, brand new, beautiful library, Historic West District, you know, like deep African American neighborhood in Vegas. Definitely has, like, some Skid Row streets, you know, it's like, right south of Fremont.

**Abdus** [1:30]
Downtown the old Fremont?

**Ronny** [1:33]
Yeah, so, like, even on the other side of the highway, of the old strip begins this neighborhood, the historic district, Historic West Side. And it's where Cashman Stadium is, and then the Neon Museum. If you ever done the Neon Museum, that's a cool one. But basically, it's a museum corridor. And it's a historical black neighborhood, like even Philly had Germantown, right? Like, so, you know, that's like a historic black neighborhood.

So the point of that is, they got a brand new, beautiful library. And they have, like a podcasting space, a 3D printer, like a CNC thing. There's going to be some really interesting events, and it'll be a cultural hub in some way for Vegas. It has a Business Innovation Center in it. So they have a celebration yesterday, happy hour, networking, and then they had a live band.

This is essentially the community for Vegas that is doing work in workforce development, right? The library is definitely like a pillar in trying to direct people to their passion and purpose. With that I spoke—I had three conversations that were like of significance, but really the best one was Anthony. He's the executive director of the Urban Chamber of Commerce.

**Abdus** [3:51]
Urban Chamber of Commerce, yeah.

**Ronny** [3:53]
Exactly. It was like black business needed to find their way, because they weren't given avenue under the regular Chamber of Commerce. So this organization existed 50 years ago, and he's now the executive director as of last year. I told him what I do as an instructional designer. And he starts getting into—oh, we just delivered a series of courses on AI and how that's changing the future of work.

He has 16 graduates going through a series of seminars that he would totally like beta test our release. And he goes, "I understand what it means to beta test. I'm building my own platform for business entrepreneurs and for gig work." So he knows what it's like to need this type of feedback. But ultimately, for what we're trying to do, this is another stakeholder in that value chain.

## The 14-Year-Old Sound Engineer

**Ronny** [5:18]
Here's another interesting moment that I think you can grasp in terms of like the pain point of a 14 year old who's curious and driven and just needs the right guide and direction. This kid comes into the Media Lab because I was geeking over the Media Lab—it was just so awesome. They had a podcasting space. They had an editing suite that was available in your public library to just rent and use.

But this kid walks in and he's solo but a man on a mission. He had this awesome necklace that looked like T'Challa, like the Platinum. And he's just like, "If I learn this equipment, will I get my certification?" That's what he asked the lady of that Media Lab. And she was just like, "What certification are you talking about?"

I don't know if she was able to motivate him, because that dude was ready to just go. He came to just like, you know, "I want to make music" or whatever his purpose from a sound engineering standpoint. He was the curious kid that, regardless of his situation, was going to skyrocket his way if he could get a path.

**Abdus** [7:40]
What is that example or that story you just provided? What's the takeaway?

**Ronny** [7:47]
14 year old trying to explore new communication tools like sound engineering and media design development. He's trying to understand at this young age how can he accelerate? How can he get professional growth? How could he build his professional identity already? He's ready. He seemed disappointed when he talked to her because she wasn't just like, "Yeah, you're gonna get the certification." He needed somebody to bridge him.

In our value chain, he's perfect for that after school program potentially, or that internship that gets him a step in with professional apprenticeship type of thing. These programs exist. The experiential learning is actually what Mary Beth's organization was trying to do—to say, all right, you're 17, maybe the traditional school environment isn't giving it for you, but you're a prime candidate to do self directed learning and go deep in an area of passion and interest.

## Direct Access vs. Intermediary Distribution

**Abdus** [9:33]
So the question you have to ask yourself then, if you have something that can help, would you give it directly, or would you need to try to do it through an intermediary?

**Ronny** [9:44]
I think what we've built is the one that helps you find the intermediary without needing a certain warmed connection to the intermediary.

**Abdus** [10:01]
Wait, hold on. Who's the intermediary then?

**Ronny** [10:04]
The after school programs, the TED, Girls Who Code things—all the everything that Innovate Alabama type organizations provide.

**Abdus** [10:14]
I mean potentially. But like, if he's not in that organization, then that's not the intermediary. Why I'm asking this question is because, depending on the answer, it determines how you would actually reach the users. Are you going to give him the URL to the app directly and have him use it? Or would you need to work through an organization, have him sign up and then provide access to it through that? Because depending on if you do it one way or the other, it changes the channel.

**Ronny** [10:43]
I would have him use it directly. We inform him about all the transferable skills and the curiosity that he has, and then routing those opportunities in his environment. The original problem was that the superintendent had a list of like 1,200 after school programs, and many of them were getting unfilled and grants not being re-instituted because of low attrition and not enough seats. We were building a way to get people into those programs.

# Part 2: Product Philosophy & Value Proposition

**Abdus** [12:08]
I hear it, but like, let's simplify it. I'm asking, you saw this person, they could use some access. Are you actually able to solve something today or not? Is it a different product, or would you give him what we have and then just see what transpires from it?

**Ronny** [12:27]
What's the call to action of the current app? You do it, you went through a couple of things that we've told you. You're—you have a certain level of curiosity. You're great at conflict resolution or something like that. But now what?

**Abdus** [12:51]
I mean potentially, but what's the call to action to reading a book? What's the call to action to watching a movie? To some extent, if this person has a specific need, then that need exists outside of the app. And if he already knows what he's interested in, then maybe he's not a good fit versus...

**Ronny** [13:13]
This goes back to our original problem. What he probably needs—because he's going to get his exposure, he probably already knows a lot of these apps, that's why he's keen on trying to get the certification. But I think what he probably doesn't know are all the different working roles for sound engineers and what it's like in that job.

I had a friend who was the sound engineer for Broadway. It's like a certain level. Vegas got a ton of that high profile type of role, union related. So initially you might be like, "I'm exploring this because I'm a creative, I want to express." What he probably doesn't know is really the range of opportunity.

**Abdus** [14:40]
Yeah, so like, if you're already hustling and you already have that part figured out, then it could just be a matter of knowing which pathways there are and then let that person bark up the tree. So the call to action isn't defined by us. The call to action is defined by the person's own agency to want to do better for themselves, but the problem is they might not know how.

There's no magic to finding a job or finding—it's literally no magic. There's not rocket science. We're not trying to create Nobel Prize physics. What we're trying to say is, potentially, there's just a gap—either in network, what you need sometimes to get access—or there's a gap in awareness, so you don't even know how to navigate. Oh, I'm a sound engineer. Okay, I could go into movies. I could go into actual music. I could create my own indie music and launch through my own platform or DistroKid or something. A lot of ways.

## The Nanostem Concept & Differentiation

**Abdus** [16:44]
You got to think, when you're building a company, people want to invest in something that's different. It has to be different. So if you're just saying, "Hey, there's organizations out there, and we can drive them candidates," that's fine. But if you end up doing it where you just have a website that says, "Oh, look, there's 20 different sound engineer boot camps you could do," that's not going to be interesting. That's like a directory for folks.

The question is, can we bake in—what we're trying to say is, okay, you're a sound engineer amateur, but there's actually professional ways to go about it that you don't have access to. But we've modeled some of the most probabilistic pathways, and we're going to give you exposure to that so you can learn how to navigate them through this nanostem. And then you could go out in your own life and figure it out.

**Ronny** [17:57]
The core curriculum for every domain or sector industry would really be the critical mindsets of that industry. And if you answer them for audio engineering, you answer that for accounting. We're not trying to give them that information the old way. The way we give that information is through these immersive stories.

---

## Building Without Expert Gatekeeping

**Abdus** [19:07]
At some point we build something, and we need to focus on that thing. And if not, then like, we either move on from the potential customer, or we completely change what we're doing. So for example, you identify this guy, he's trying to get into sound engineering, correct? Trying to become a sound producer.

**Ronny** [19:26]
He was pointing to the Media Lab, and his question was, "Will I get a certification?" So that was his greatest concern right there, which is somewhat juvenile, but he is 14.

**Abdus** [19:42]
But the certification isn't an end, it's a means to something. So let's think deeper. He wants a certification to do what? What does that mean for him?

**Abdus** [20:11]
Stop there though, just stop there. He would like to do sound engineering potentially for a sports stadium. The thing is, though, he has no clue how to go about that, correct?

**Ronny** [20:20]
Doesn't even know it exists in some way like that.

**Abdus** [20:23]
Yeah, correct. So that's why I'm like—top of the funnel, all we're talking about is awareness. And we're saying there could be value even creating awareness for someone who's motivated and hungry, but just doesn't—he's going to the library and asking them to do something. It could be good, but as you see, it's also not actually going anywhere.

Should he stop his pursuit of what he's trying to achieve, or is there potentially other paths he should focus on? If you were his mentor, you would be providing him probably other channels.

---

## iTunes for Real World Experiences

**Ronny** [23:08]
That was always the reason why we were scared to do this—we didn't want to be in content creation hell. But if you could really approach every category of industry and sector and role, and have a nanostem or a series of those that help you understand some core aspects of it—that's incredible. And maybe we started to believe that today's technology can get us there.

---

## "Broken Systems" — The Foundational Thesis

**Abdus** [32:31]
We already acknowledged—looking for a job, getting a job, finding a career, being able to move adjacently to different industries in a career, being able to build an effort—these are all broken systems. They're broken. They don't work. Millions of unemployed Americans who want a job, who can't find work, who have degrees, PhDs. So I'm not so interested in trying to model broken systems. I'm actually here to institute better ways, which to me would involve, to some extent, hyper-jumping some of this stuff. Let's go with technology.

---

## Target Audience & Industry Focus

**Ronny** [33:19]
Let's go back to the other guy who I thought was a more interesting opportunity in terms of being able to beta test and in terms of his mandate—this is the Urban Chamber of Commerce. And we've already been modeling a little bit of that. I think you were doing it off of World Economic Forum and whatnot regarding the future of work.

I think we pursue the area, at least in our first round, rather than go to every single industry—but focusing on maybe opportunity for that age group of like 14 to early career. Where's the opportunity for them? It's cybersecurity, or maybe it's finance, whatever it is. The library itself believes it's 3D printing and robotic engineering—that's what this institution is making a stab at for the youth. If we identify the emerging industry, we start with those groups and we create.

**Ronny** [35:16]
We've been going—the range is early careers, which could be, "Hey, you're 14, welcome. You should see yourself as a professional. Here's the step," all the way to like, "You're still trying to be a world traveler. You're still trying to get into your next industry. You're in your early 30s." That's our range of users, essentially, for what we're creating at the moment.

Then there's also the range of industries that we focus in on. And I think the focus can be based on governmental stats about economic growth—the growth of the future. So we're creating nanostems on the topics of the future. Because like, why teach people about an opportunity that doesn't lead to opportunity?

---

## The Core Problem We're Solving

**Abdus** [36:21]
I'm with you. And yes, this is correct—I would say table stakes. Obviously we're giving people experiences about what's going to be useful for them now and in the present. Like, why are we not teaching people how to take horses and carriages or fill up petroleum? Maybe that could actually be a useful, cool, nostalgic nanostem that actually teaches skills that would be relevant in the future.

But you got to remember, you got to take it back even further. What was the whole problem we were solving with Actualize Me? Essentially, people were finishing high school not knowing what the hell they wanted to do. So they were going to college, racking up a shit ton of debt and still not having the right career path. So if we can simply solve—with exposure and nanostems—people knowing how to pick the right major, we've actually done a huge good to society.

**Ronny** [37:11]
Yeah, yes, yes. That's been it. So it's like—it's a hypothesis that I think we ultimately need to validate. Once we have our 10,000 users and celebrate our million—like, at 1,000 we'll be able to say that, yes, that was our thesis. But actually, the white paper we just published—that the people who went through our experience had invested and therefore yielded a better return on investment post-college, or were even more likely to finish in the first place. I truly believe you will be able to say that statement with what we're currently building and designing. We can improve it from alpha, beta to final. But the experience—learner experience, wide range for career exploration.

## Build Small, Generalize Big

**Abdus** [38:37]
I did that in like third grade. Our friend's dad was an ophthalmologist, so he came and did one of our science classes, and we had to dissect the cow eye, and that's how he taught us. And so that could be a perfect nanostem—and I did that in third grade. It could be useful if you're in med school.

So I would also say, don't be so worried about us being pigeonholed into a particular segment. Build for something small, and we'll find out that that solution that solves that very small niche will actually be much more generalizable to a much larger audience.

**Abdus** [23:41]
Dude, I'm in it. I'm balls deep in it. Probably it could be done, trust me, there's much more sophisticated stuff being done with AI. But all we're talking about is content creation at scale. I think that the trickier part, but it's not tricky, it just takes time, is finding actual real people who were talking or discussing about the things, so that we're just not making random things up.

**Abdus** [23:08]
We don't have to create custom—we just have to add the nanostems to the library. It's like we're creating iTunes for real world experiences. So we just need—remember yesterday, we kind of said, the larger the catalog probably the better value, because we covered more surface area.

---

## The UMG Example — Understanding Both Sides

**Abdus** [24:25]
Right now, there's like little landmarks about Birmingham in the nanostem. We could easily link out to—like, now this producer of this global media company—you could do a scenario where someone works already at UMG, and they're coming out with a new artist, and they're talking about how new they are, and they don't know the results that are going to be when they release their new album. So there's a lot of pressure on that executive to do this.

So it kind of helps that person understand both the risks that the company takes in signing them, as well as helps them understand how they should think about it. Because when you're doing business, you have to not just know yourself—you have to know the other stakeholder. When you're going for a job, you have to really actually know more about the company than talking about self. So these nanostems are just ways to kind of create this as close to, "Oh, this is what's going on when I'm saying I like this thing or I like this hobby."

---

## The Podcast Strategy — Sourcing Authentic Content

**Ronny** [25:27]
The job feel—which is different. It doesn't answer it verbatim, but just by putting you into a situation, you start—you know what I mean? And that's kind of what the technical scenario with the heart monitor was, for sure.

But to what you had said—that was a point I wanted to raise. The validity of our nanostems, right? Where are we sourcing our data about when we're saying we're transparent about how these roles transpire in the workforce in a more authentic way? How are we getting that information?

And that's why I thought this strategy of us showing up to people's podcasts and doing like a blast to their community is an interesting way to elevate an SME, penetrate a silo, and use it as an event to create nanostems.

**Abdus** [26:38]
Who's asking that question?

**Ronny** [26:42]
I think influencer community leaders—industry leaders whose job is to influence and maintain a community—are looking for ways to not only engage but to build wellbeing. And if then what you've already designed—that personal wellbeing—is really what helps that individual community.

---

## The Two Nanostem Test

**Abdus** [27:21]
Let me give you two scenarios. I have two nanostems. Nanostem A was developed in partnership with the leading career guidance professionals of the world, and it takes people through a scenario. And we tested it with 20 people, and 99% of them didn't finish it. Then we have our own nanostem. We created our own version of that use case based on our understanding of making it cool and engaging, and 90% of people are actually using it every day. Which nanostem would you take?

**Ronny** [27:59]
I think you start—address the person in need. But increase the quality.

**Abdus** [28:08]
I'm asking a simple question. Which nanostem is performing better? I gave you two versions. One developed in accordance with these professionals—no one's using it though—versus another nanostem we created, and we have a ton of engagement on.

**Ronny** [28:38]
A ton of engagement, of course, because engagement is going to win. But I don't want to partner and do like a long, prolonged six month development process to design a course. I want to be able to just take the transcripts of the media they're already producing—that is a wealth of these personal stories, the work of whatever professional, software engineer, really transpires in the workplace. And then I want to use that to map our engagement.

---

## The SpaceX Nanostem Example

**Abdus** [43:23]
It can be very specific. If you said this guy does sound engineering, then we can just have a menu and you just select it. It's general now because I've kind of built it generally. But if we're actually partnering with an organization—say that we're partnering with NASA—I'm not going to give them the figure skating content. I'm gonna give them our astrophysics and rocket science nanostem coursework.

The way those experiences won't be so explicit, like, "Oh, you're going to learn the academic curriculum and use your syllabus." It's going to actually be like, we're throwing you into a mission critical SpaceX launch, and the last launch failed, and you're meeting with the head of NASA who's super stressed out about it. Can you help them through it? That's the magic. That to me is like, if you can do that, that's the IP—a novel way to engage people through digital mechanisms and storytelling.

**Ronny** [45:11]
Because there's a little bit of a black box about what those roles are in some way. People want to know—what is it really like?

**Abdus** [45:26]
To your point, you would say, well, we should talk to NASA or talk to someone adjacent who knows that industry. My seventh grade physics teacher used to work for NASA. So there are people accessible. I agree, we should find those people. But that shouldn't be like a validation binary where if we can't find this person, we can't create the nanostem for that.

We can nanostem anything, and then we can enhance it through an actual professional tie to it. And then we can create the network where we start tying professionals to the nanostems. But that's secondary—we're going beyond MVP. When you start going into this, we're going into functionality that doesn't even matter yet if we don't have engagement from the nanostem itself.

---

## Startup Philosophy: Build First

**Abdus** [41:25]
We need experts. I'm saying, if an expert saying, "Oh no, I'm not interested in that," if that could slow us down, then I'm saying we're actually fundamentally putting our company foundationally on something that we shouldn't. To some extent, even when I built this app for doctors, I was like, fuck it. Let me do my research, let me do my diligence, let me do my customer discovery. But I'm building it.

Because sometimes people don't know what they want or what they need, especially if you're building something new. No one was like, "The job I want is an iPhone." That's the whole point of being a founder. Sometimes you have to build some new shit.

**Abdus** [47:57]
That's startup way. In startup ways, you just build it, and then you send it to 20 people who are in this astrophysics academy, and you see if they're like, "Oh shit, this is kind of cool."

---

## Urban Chamber of Commerce — The Beta Test Opportunity

**Ronny** [48:43]
So for this guy, in terms of an opportunity—the Urban Chamber of Commerce is apparently a 17,000 square foot facility. This is not like a nonprofit with a desk and a phone.

**Abdus** [48:39]
They're probably giving out SBA—probably small businesses in the area, minority business owners.

**Ronny** [48:43]
Business owners. And there's all sorts of programs—there's a housing program coming out of that. Whatever it is, theoretically he has a curriculum that he's trying to promote, and our tool would be a complementary tool to help people think and get immersed in the careers about the content that they're putting out or getting ready to release.

He wants to talk to me as much as—you know, next week, get on the calendar. That's what he said. So I see us—we can. Curriculum is so very relevant. We just talk about the emerging risks of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. I mean, that's literally how I spent my last five years professionally. So AI obviously being one of them, and there's this curriculum that he's got, and we would be a complementary experience to the course offering for his cohort that wants to test.

**Abdus** [49:53]
What is he offering—content or different tools?

**Ronny** [49:57]
Right now he has like 10 hours of—probably prompt engineering.

**Abdus** [50:07]
No, no—how do people interact with it?

**Ronny** [50:12]
One, he has this cohort of 16 that are going through this—this is their homework. But I bet you there's really a deeper interest.

---

## The Patent & IP Definition

**Abdus** [50:23]
There's only so many things you can do. You can either do a classroom, you can do a virtual Zoom, you can do a multiple choice test, you could create your own virtual animated version, you could do it live, you could have it by audio. So like, these are—it's important you understand this, because if I say, do a patent on this platform today, this is what you're patenting. You're patenting the way of delivery of information to people. And that's the whole thing.

Like, remember LinkedIn tried to imitate TikTok and Instagram. It was cool, but it's not catching on, because it's the way people are already used to, and they have an even better alternative. So rather than try to create that or even a search, what I did was look at what's the next gen interaction tools? That's your ChatGPT, that's your Claude, that's your Perplexity—and those are much more of a chatbot.

Remember when we had that insight, like when we first started reconnecting, we were just like, "Is it possible it's just a fucking chatbot?" Yes, from a UI standpoint, but no—we're actually delivering a multimedia story. Dude, this is like, I used to dream about doing this kind of stuff.

**Ronny** [51:30]
I told you that I got into this business because I wanted to make video games that teach something. And even though we're text based right now, we're building an expertise in immersive simulation, where we're getting people into a scenario with the least amount of knowledge dump that needs to occur before they even go in the scenario.

But it's not as much of being able to simulate, because a lot of people, right now, a lot of learning designers are simulating with these tools in a similar way. But it's the others. It's the fact that we're attached to the actual—it's the insights we're providing. That was that "Aha" at the bar that I said yesterday. I started to really understand—what the Insights is, essentially, is our teaching moment where we're saying, "FYI, these are important transferable skills in the marketplace, and these are important mindsets for that specific industry, and you've already won, and you have a skill tree—keep pursuing." So that's the education.

---

## The "Next Best Action" Philosophy

**Abdus** [52:56]
What do you just say? And, no, not what you just said exactly, but like, why are you saying what you just said? Are you saying that's the value you're delivering to those venues?

**Ronny** [53:04]
That's the edge. There's the educational component about the domain, the content itself—like you're saying, "This is an external heart monitor. This is something that person in that role has to deal with"—getting the visceral understanding of it because we immersed you.

**Abdus** [53:23]
Wait, wait, okay, just stop there. Just stop there, because that's—you're getting the real experience because we immerse. That is true, that's true. But what we're trying to really sell—I feel like the real value that we believe we can get people to pay us for is that now, because of that, that next phone call you're going to make is going to be right to the decision maker or person you need to talk to. Or now, when you create that new thing for your portfolio that you're already working on, on this completely different tool, you'll know exactly how to position and market that.

We're—it's like, you don't have to—the human being who's using this is the stakeholder who needs to tell you, "I like it." Don't worry about the psychiatrist, the teacher, the academic guidance counselor. Actually, what we're trying to say with Actualize Me is that the individual will embrace the experience and do the next best action.

I think you said that earlier—the next best action. The next best action doesn't happen on our platform. The next best action will actually happen outside of our platform. And we're okay with that. We are okay.

**Ronny** [54:37]
But now, before they leave our platform—that's where I believe the magic happens. They went through that experience. They're feeling like, "This is that COPS model—there's this opportunity out there. It's interesting that I've gotten a little bit deeper into an area of my interest." But then when you shift into the insights part, you go, "Oh, and my interests have all these characteristics. They're called—boom—all the skills analytics that you've exposed because of your decision making. You've exhibited X skill."

And then your perception of yourself is now different because you're like, "Oh, I don't just have—I have more meat to my interest. I have a vocabulary." It's the mindset, because that's the only thing you can teach in this rapidly changing world. You teach that broad level—this is the attitude, this is where these people have highs and lows.

## Corporate Advertising Model (Nanostems as Bids)

**Abdus** [55:49]
What if the platform—what if the nanostems just weren't these curriculum education models, but they were actually advertising? Ads? Or what do you call them—like listings?

**Ronny** [56:04]
Job post? You're saying like—

**Abdus** [56:05]
No, like advertising bids. So we work with corporates, they can bid on the nanostem so that it's branded to their brand, so that when someone's taking it, they're actually kind of working through the career pipeline of that company. But it's still unique and novel—you're in a scenario—and then that data can be provided back to them so they can understand how well that person did and how they would do at it. And at the same time, that person received an authentic, real experience. It didn't feel like corporate mumbo jumbo.

**Ronny** [56:38]
I think that stuff does already exist in some way. Like, we know—

**Abdus** [56:44]
The sales model, yeah. That's exactly what I did for Paragon One. That's how I would sell into the company. But the product is different. This isn't a Paragon One solution, because that was just qualitative "answer these questions." We still have the patented, novel way of content delivery, and we've created now a new way of advertising where you've kind of bid on content—but not content as an ad, content as an engagement experience.

## Trust as Greatest Capital

**Ronny** [57:10]
I think one of the biggest—especially for this topic—I don't know really how it manifests, but they trust us because of our integrity. Trust is one of the greatest things that we're building. Because we are capturing data about you and kind of your deepest—helping you define your purpose in some ways, right, by giving you the vocabulary to define it, by engaging in our experiences.

So when we're saying we'll give employers a window into your data, I think—in a way where it doesn't erode trust, and that we're very transactional—that's my worry about the risks.

**Abdus** [58:15]
Wait, what's the risk?

**Ronny** [58:17]
The loss of trust. If you really want this to succeed in the way that you're envisioning—at the highest levels—I think our greatest capital is trust. Our greatest value is that we are a trusted voice for you to go and explore what the real world looks like without the barrier to entry.

**Abdus** [58:47]
But what's the trust? What's the risk part of that?

**Ronny** [58:51]
If you're selling this access—my data about my candidacy, my interest, my values—to employers, are they gonna hurt my candidacy or not?

**Abdus** [59:10]
Nothing's designed in the platform to say you suck at something. Everything was to help you actually understand the stuff that you're probably already good at that you never knew how to express or communicate.

**Ronny** [59:22]
That's to the individual. But if that data is going out to the employer—to potential—what you're saying, this business model...

## Unilever vs. Harvard (The Value of Access)

**Abdus** [59:30]
So on one end, yes, the employer could look at the data and say, "Okay, no." But here's the thing—we're actually solving a problem, which is: Unilever has a lower acceptance rate than Harvard. You get what I'm saying? It's actually more competitive to try to get a Fortune 500 job than it is to get into an Ivy League college.

So the implications of that is, you can't afford not getting—to be honest, if you got in front of a decision maker or even the algorithms at Unilever, you might as well pay us for that, because we just helped you bypass the largest—if I could get my profile in front of the person at Meta, I'd be so much more confident in doing job applications and all that kind of stuff. It's the whole reason why "I don't think my shit will ever make it" that prevents me from taking action sometimes.

**Ronny** [1:00:28]
Yeah, so that's where I think—if it's mutual, if it's kind of like, "All right, you've exhibited—let's say maybe that's kind of the capstone of the skill tree. It's kind of like, look, you've gone five steps. Step six: would you like to share your data with X company who designed the final simulation?" And then it's just like, "Yeah, I guess."

**Abdus** [1:00:56]
Just have a global button, like, "Do you want to share your data?" And then if people don't want to share their data, they can opt out, and their data won't be shared. Just keep it simple.

## The "Reading a Book" Analogy

**Abdus** [1:02:56]
It's like reading a book. You can read a book and then you can put the book down, and there's no strings attached.

**Ronny** [1:03:08]
Okay, so then that's the statement: We use your data in aggregate to help organizations better reach you and elevate your candidacy—or whatever it is. But that's the point. I promise you that in the HR world, trust is an issue and data transparency is important.

**Abdus** [1:03:56]
I think you're imposing an HR philosophy on the candidate. I wouldn't do that. The HR issue is different than the candidate issue. HR would have a policy that says we have to tell people this. If I'm building something—when I Google something, Google's not telling me "we're taking a cookie." The software already does that.

If this was an app on the App Store, when you download an app, you already see the permission privileges—"this app may access your camera, this app may access your contacts." So we're already going to have to declare that. A lot of this stuff is already built into technology, so we don't have to say this on the app.

# Part 3: UI/UX Review & Design Feedback

**Ronny** [1:05:12]
So just other things for the UI—what is the experience from an accessibility standpoint? I think that's important for us to know. Are we building it for people with disabilities? I think we're text based, so it's got to be super easy.

**Abdus** [1:05:45]
When you're doing the HTML, really, to be honest, in the tags, you just add ARIA labels, which are universal pointers that screen readers will pick up on. It'll change your iPhone settings to larger font—it'll pick up. So that's standard.

**Ronny** [1:06:03]
The current font—it's all kind of similar. It could be bigger, just in general.

**Abdus** [1:06:10]
I agree.

**Ronny** [1:06:57]
The body font that you have there—I would use when I was using something more fancy, like Times New Roman, whereas I would prefer like that Arial, just like read your story in a block.

**Abdus** [1:07:12]
And I had that originally, I changed the font. So you want to go back to the Arial, right?

**Ronny** [1:07:18]
If you're gonna have people do deep reading, let it be easy on the eyes. You keep your headings looking royal and presidential, but I also think there's an opportunity to change the background color of the story space. The NPC narrative versus the choices—I want to create more space, because right now they're both the same color. I like the highlights that you made, but there's still—I think it needs just a little bit more delineation.

**Ronny** [1:10:04]
This is kind of why I was saying yesterday, I think we're creating our own genre. When you were kind of like, "Why can't somebody pick up a book and put it down?"

**Abdus** [1:10:11]
Like, I showed you that too.

**Ronny** [1:10:21]
We're creating a new modality for career exploration.

## The Data Disclaimer (In-App Copy)

**Abdus** [1:11:28]
I hear you saying that the station has—like you're saying, hey, we need to help people understand that there's something happening here. Here's the copy: "The station has a way of memory. Every choice you make leaves an echo. Over time, these echoes gather—it becomes something you can see. Think of it as a mirror, not of what you've done, but of who you are." This is literally the data disclaimer.

---

**Ronny** [1:11:49]
Basically, the way when in the browser right now, there's a large space between the buttons, so it's easy to be able to see. That light gray versus the flat white that's popping out—it's enough. But when you're compressed on the iPhone, there's like no space between those buttons. And I'm getting a lot of—I have to scroll the top stage to be able to read everything, and then I have to scroll my choices to read everything.

**Abdus** [1:12:25]
So what are you saying? What should be the case then?

**Ronny** [1:12:29]
One, I would consider making a contrast. For it to be a black background and white text, or something like that—if that's useful. A bigger difference between the two containers. Like, you know, to stand out, to be able to see that they are two containers.

**Ronny** [1:13:01]
The use of a scroll bar—should it just be more of a story? Could it be more of a carousel? Especially the stage—the stage should probably be a carousel over a scroll down.

**Abdus** [1:13:25]
It should be going left to right.

**Ronny** [1:15:06]
It's not just space. I think it's more of a visual—if the stage above had a darker background and lighter font, then you would know it's just like a totally different work area. There's this prompt, and then I have my answer.

**Ronny** [1:16:00]
And then my other concern is, from a design standpoint, either randomize how those choices are appearing—the order that those choices are appearing. Like the one that had eight choices, I don't want to pigeonhole people into the first three answers because they didn't scroll down. That's human behavior. People do that all the time.

**Abdus** [1:16:36]
Do you want to make it horizontal choices rather than vertical?

**Ronny** [1:16:41]
Yeah. Maybe—I don't know what's the easiest way to make all those options available, but if it's not possible, what's the best way that's possible?

**Abdus** [1:16:50]
It's possible. And it used to be—I used to actually have like a two by two, like Who Wants to Be a Millionaire format.

**Ronny** [1:17:25]
Making sure that you put in your accessibility—that we are doing the compliance there. The feedback that I just gave you about trying to get the stage to stand out and the choice scroll issue—those were my direct feedback.

**Ronny** [1:22:01]
I love that blue highlight on the side. It looks really done. I would almost make it more blue. It's like not blue enough.

**Abdus** [1:22:24]
It's subtle. I'm keeping it subtle for now.

**Ronny** [1:22:27]
But then it's just the bottom horizontal—the bottom of that box and how it hits the next box. They don't have enough to separate.

**Ronny** [1:22:52]
I'm thinking Spider-Verse kind of thing—they break up the spaces. I wonder if the questions area was a little bit more textured, and the stage area was—I like this flashing blue, make the blue more prominent maybe.

**Ronny** [1:23:21]
It's not everything needs to have—this is my feedback from going through it. There's just points where it looks like something's broken, but it's not. It's just that you didn't create enough visual space between what's in your foreground and what's in your background. In this case, in the foreground is the questions, in the background is the stage area.

**Abdus** [1:24:06]
I also realize this is all custom CSS. There's no perfect visual. It's all custom implemented design, which is pretty cool.

**Ronny** [1:24:16]
No, I like that. So in reality, it's more just to go through two iterations and call it done, kind of thing.

## The Mary Beth Scenario Discussion

**Ronny** [1:24:47]
Else, you know—the idea of us putting that scenario in for Mary Beth, right?

**Abdus** [1:24:55]
I already took that out, so I'm pretty sure—

**Ronny** [1:25:00]
I don't necessarily—it's not that I don't like it. I kind of do. But wait, one, I don't think it's relevant. Like, are we trying to get people to explore what it's like to be a principal? Is that one of the careers we're talking about?

**Abdus** [1:25:17]
Yeah, because it talked about how she would need to present in front of a bunch of stakeholders. And like, yeah, because ultimately, I kind of coached her through how to do that properly, which was an important skill, so I thought it was valuable.

**Ronny** [1:25:29]
So I like this scenario. I think we keep it because—why are we using your exact name, unless it's for that reason?

**Abdus** [1:26:00]
I think I changed it so it's like the Catcher in the Rye use case.

---

**Ronny** [1:37:16]
There are times when the container above starts to merge into the container below. When you have to do scrolling in both of those areas, it looks like one area kind of bleeds into the other. And your brain thinks something's broken, but in reality, it just needs probably a deeper border on the horizontal.

**Abdus** [1:37:40]
But you can't have a deeper border if it's overlapping. So what you're saying is, first, you need to separate the two containers so there's space between them.

**Abdus** [1:37:51]
Like padding, padding top. You just add some padding between.

**Ronny** [1:41:19]
So that's where I thought maybe the top is actually a side scrolling carousel, and the bottom is up and down.

# Part 4: Nanostem Creation Workflow & Next Steps

**Abdus** [1:43:42]
All right, so just a quick example. This is how we create nanostems. Essentially, we set out what's happening, and then you kind of see the choices. Each choice maps to a pattern, and then that pattern reveals something. And then in the next scene, once again, the choice is what they map to. And then the scene again—it's just a formula. So we can take both real world experiences as well.

**Ronny** [1:44:17]
I want to create avenues for the formal, but to what you're saying—it's like we don't need the validation in order to deliver the experience. We already have what we need to create engagement. But I would love for, you know—I want to say Carol Dweck, the person who created the growth mindset—to give us her principles and put it into our system. And then her community and all the millions of people that follow her leadership advice will have exposure to this tool that is now incorporated.

I want to leave room for those partnerships from a business standpoint. But to reach what we need to do next week, we don't need any of that expertise in that regard.

## Ronny's Brother's Advice & The AI Pathway

**Ronny** [1:29:35]
We probably still need to connect and just talk about release. Maybe we're just doing one more—you're creating one more link in the next day that is final for beta version one for us to hand to our immediate network. And then we were going to talk about who's that—this guy would be on the spreadsheet.

This is a follow up. I think it goes back to my brother's advice, which was: our current experience should facilitate the next conversations we want to have. So for this guy, as long as we have an AI-relevant example—

**Ronny** [1:30:45]
Is there a pathway that will help people go in exploring the future of work as AI?

**Abdus** [1:30:52]
Yeah, I already have an AI one in here.

**Ronny** [1:30:57]
So even if it's not, we could—after a conversation with him, he says, "Look, these are really the four or five main topics we cover, and these are the major roles that we've mapped to, because we have programs to support cybersecurity and AI." So long as we can provide the content that is complementary to his content, I think there's an immediate use, both for use case but also to perpetually use our app in the long run.

## The Prompt Engineering Critique

**Abdus** [1:34:41]
You've got to be careful, right? You're saying "prompt engineering"—that's going to turn off a ton of users already, because it's like, why even learn prompt engineering? Prompt engineering isn't something to learn. It's like—you just do it if you know how to ask questions. The real question is: how do you build applications with it? But let's take—I think there's actually a perfect use case, because this is probably what a lot of people will experience. We're spinning up multiple agents. Watch this: "You are the narrative channel agent. Please analyze this and then create a new NPC story."

**Ronny** [1:33:20]
It's not just one place. I mean, I could tell you how AI impacts the instructional designer. The job becomes a lot more like what you're doing. You're a data scientist storyteller, because the AI is managing the experience more.

**Abdus** [1:45:18]
Yeah, two things can be true. We can do what we need to do and do that as well. All right, I think my friend's having like a random birthday Zoom, I said I'd stop by, so let me do that really quickly. And I know you got to make moves. So let's sync back up, maybe tomorrow—that'd be better. Next week when I get back in town.

**Ronny** [1:45:40]
So it's just about—you'll already have a final link. We'll be specific about who we want to outreach and what we're gonna say, and then we do it. Cool, cool. June, you wanna say goodbye? She's right—she's busy. Love you, be good man, take care.
