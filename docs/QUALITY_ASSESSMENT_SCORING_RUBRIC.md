| **4-5** | Significant information gaps | Players asked to spend resources they can't see |
| **1-3** | Critical information failures | Major decisions made with incomplete information |
| **0** | Complete information failure | Players cannot determine consequences of actions |

#### **HARD STOP THRESHOLD: 5.0** 
*Any score below 5.0 triggers automatic "No Launch" recommendation*

**Example Assessment:**
```
❌ SCORE: 3/10
Problem: Game asks player to spend "3 days" but no day counter visible
Impact: Players cannot make strategic resource decisions

✅ SCORE: 9/10  
Success: Energy bar shows current/max before every energy-based choice
Minor gap: Skill point totals not visible during skill-based decisions
```
