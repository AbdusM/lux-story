## The Killer Insight

**You're not building "a game" or "a career tool."**

**You're building the infrastructure for narrative intelligence at scale.**

The game is the proof point.
The B2B is the initial revenue.
The platform is the moonshot.

In 5 years, Grand Central Terminus could be:
- The place where 100,000+ creators publish scenarios
- The source of truth for youth career readiness
- The IP franchise (game, podcast, Netflix, merchandise)
- A $500M+ company acquired by education tech or gaming giant

**But first:** Run the pilot. Launch itch.io. Get data.
