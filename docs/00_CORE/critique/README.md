# The Critical Conscience
**"Show your brilliance. Don't bury it."**

## Purpose
This directory contains the "Shadow Documentation" — critical audits, reality checks, and philosophical arguments that challenge the optimistic view of the Design Documents. 

These artifacts are preserved not as historical curiosities, but as the **Active Conscience** of the project, reminding us of the gap between *Intent* and *Reality*.

## The Collection

### [FIVE_LENSES_AUDIT_DEC2024.md](./FIVE_LENSES_AUDIT_DEC2024.md)
**The UX Critique.** A brutal assessment of the "Iceberg Problem" (60% of game value is hidden).
*   **Key Concept:** "Progressive Paralysis" (Empty states feel broken).
*   **Key Concept:** "The Refund Test" (Would a 5-minute player return it?).

### [CHOICE_CONSEQUENCE_PHILOSOPHY.md](./CHOICE_CONSEQUENCE_PHILOSOPHY.md)
**The Systems Critique.** An honest look at which systems essentially fake/vestigial.
*   **Key Admission:** The Skills System is effectively "Dead Code".
*   **Key Admission:** The Trust System works (100%), but Pattern Tracking is "Silent" (4%).

### [FAKE_CHOICE_AUDIT_DEC15.md](./FAKE_CHOICE_AUDIT_DEC15.md)
**The Narrative Critique.** A content audit identifying where player agency is an illusion.
*   **Key Finding:** "Narrative Funnels" where independent choices force the same outcome.
*   **Key Finding:** "Tone-Blind Responses" where NPCs ignore player intent.

### [BLOAT_AUDIT.md](./BLOAT_AUDIT.md)
**The Code Critique.** A technical audit identifying "State vs Content" confusion.
*   **Key Finding:** 6,700 lines of logic that should be data.
*   **Key Finding:** Vestigial systems like "Crossroads" that were implemented but never wired.
