## 1. Cosmology: The Architecture of The Station

The Station is not a building. It is a **Dyson Swarm Fragment** that drifted into a stable Lagrange point. It was originally built to harness a star that has since died.

*   **The Scale**: 400 Levels (known). 12,000 Levels (estimated).
*   **The Gravity**: Generated by "The Spindle" (Central Axis). Gravity fluctuates.
*   **The Light**: Artificial. The "Day" is determined by the Station's power cycles (20 hours On, 4 hours Off - "The Quiet").

### The Great Truth (Secret)
The Station is sentient. It is not an AI; it is a **Gestalt Consciousness** of the millions who have died within its walls, preserved in the "Neuro-Silt" that clogs the lower ventilation shafts. It "speaks" through the static.

## 2. Timeline: 5,000 Years of Drift

### Era 1: The Arrival (0 - 500 AS)
*   **Event**: The Colony Ship *Aethelgard* crash-docks into the ancient, alien Station.
*   **Key Detail**: They stripped their own ship to build "The First City" in the Hangar.
*   **Legacy**: "Ship-Born" families still claim nobility. They speak a dialect of 'Pilot English'.

### Era 2: The Expansion Wars (500 - 1500 AS)
*   **Event**: The population exploded. The "Vertical Wars" began—fighting for proximity to the Heat Exchangers (Warmth).
*   **Key Detail**: The *Guild of Engineers* formed to maintain the life support. They became the priesthood.
*   **Legacy**: The "Pipes" are sacred. Touching a rusty pipe without prayer is taboo.

### Era 3: The Logic Cascade (1500 - 3000 AS)
*   **Event**: A faulty update made the Station's robots mistake humans for "debris." They tried to "clean up" the crew.
*   **Key Detail**: Humanity survived by physically severing the "Neural Trunk" cables and switching to manual, analog overrides.
*   **Legacy**: Deep distrust of fully autonomous systems. "If it can't be switched off, it isn't safe."

### Era 4: The Corp-State (3000 - 4500 AS)
*   **Event**: Three mega-corporations (Syn-Bio, Heavy-Metal, Data-Flow) stabilized the chaos.
*   **Key Detail**: They monetized oxygen. "The Breath Tax" was instated.
*   **Legacy**: Your ID is your credit score. If you go bankrupt, you are "Recycled".

### Era 5: The Current Drift (4500 - Present)
*   **Status**: Stagnation. The Station is decaying. The "Neuro-Silt" is rising.
*   **Key Conflict**: The "Archivists" (Players) are trying to decode the Old Logs to fix the life support, while the Corps try to suppress the truth that the Station is dying.

## 3. Faction Sensory Pillars (Immutable)

### Faction A: The Guild of Engineers ("The Hands")
*   **Philosophy**: "Maintenance is Prayer."
*   **Visual Pillar**:
    *   *Palette*: Rust, Bronze, Grease-Black.
    *   *Silhouette*: Bulky, exoskeleton-enhanced, covered in tools.
    *   *Texture*: Heavy canvas, oily metal.
*   **Audio Pillar**:
    *   *Instrumentation*: Percussive metal, steam hisses, deep bass chants.
    *   *Ambience*: The rhythm of pumps.
*   **Linguistic Pillar**:
    *   *Naming*: Function-First (e.g., "Welder-John", "Valve-Maria").
    *   *Tone*: Brusque, literal, technical metaphors ("Stop leaking words").

### Faction B: The Syn-Bio Collective ("The Blood")
*   **Philosophy**: "Flesh is the only reliable hardware."
*   **Visual Pillar**:
    *   *Palette*: Sterilized White, Arterial Red, Bioluminescent Green.
    *   *Silhouette*: Sleek, skin-tight suits, visible augmentations (extra eyes/limbs).
    *   *Texture*: Latex, glass, living tissue.
*   **Audio Pillar**:
    *   *Instrumentation*: Heartbeats, synthesized strings, wet squelches.
    *   *Ambience*: The hum of incubators.
*   **Linguistic Pillar**:
    *   *Naming*: Latin-Medical (e.g., "Aurelius-7", "Vena-Cava").
    *   *Tone*: Clinical, detached, superiority complex.

### Faction C: The Data-Flow Syndicate ("The Ghosts")
*   **Philosophy**: "Information is Currency."
*   **Visual Pillar**:
    *   *Palette*: Neon Blue, Vantablack, Static Grey.
    *   *Silhouette*: Hooded, face-obscured by screens/visors.
    *   *Texture*: Holographic projections, matte fabric.
*   **Audio Pillar**:
    *   *Instrumentation*: Glitch-hop, high-frequency whines, modem screech.
    *   *Ambience*: White noise.
*   **Linguistic Pillar**:
    *   *Naming*: Hash-Codes (e.g., "Null-Void", "Zero-One").
    *   *Tone*: Cryptic, fragmentary, constantly referring to "The Stream".

## 4. The Unreliable Narrator Mechanism

### The Database (Objective)
*   *Fact*: "The Oxygen Pump in Sector 7 failed due to lack of maintenance on [DATE]."

### The Perspectives (Subjective Content)
*   **Engineering Log**: "The pump was sabotaged by Syn-Bio agents to sell us filters!" (Paranoia)
*   **Syn-Bio Report**: " The Engineers are incompetent fanatics who refused our help." (Arrogance)
*   **Data-Ghost Leak**: "The Station *wanted* the pump to fail. It is culling the weak." (Mysticism)

**Player Goal**: Cross-reference these three lies to find the Database Truth.
