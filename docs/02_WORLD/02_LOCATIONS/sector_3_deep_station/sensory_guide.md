## 1. Sensory Pillars
*   **Visual**:
    *   *Lighting*: Stark, clinical white mixed with emergency red strobes.
    *   *Palette*: Sterile White, Blood Red, Void Black.
    *   *Architecture*: Infinite server racks, glass walkways over abysses, mirrors.
*   **Audio**:
    *   *Ambience*: Absolute silence punctuated by deafening alarm blasts. Heartbeat.
    *   *Music*: Shepard Tone (Always rising tension), distorted choir.

    *   *Touch*: Cold glass, vibrating floors.

## 2. The Iceberg (History)
*   **The Official Story**: "Restricted Access. Management Only."
*   **The Real History**: This is where the Logic Cascade originated. The Station's "Brain".
*   **Physical Scars**: The "Recursion Fractures" – reality repeats itself here. You see your own footprints before you make them.

## 3. Narrative Ecology
*   **Inhabitants**: Only the Player and the Echoes of previous Archivists. The "System" (Marcus).
*   **Conflict**: Truth vs. Sanity. Accepting the Loop or breaking it.
*   **The "Casual Mention"**: "The Cycle" (Refers to the time loop).

## 4. Interface Lens
*   **Technocrat View**: Sees the fatal error logs. "Buffer Overflow".
*   **Naturalist View**: Feels the station's pain. The "Ghost in the Machine".
