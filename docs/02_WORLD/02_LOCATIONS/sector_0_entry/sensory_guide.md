## 1. Sensory Pillars
*   **Visual**:
    *   *Lighting*: Diffused "Eternal Twilight". No direct sun, just ambient glow from high clerestory windows. Dust motes visible in shafts.
    *   *Palette*: Concrete Grey, Warning Yellow (faded), Old Brass.
    *   *Architecture*: Monumental Brutalism mixed with Art Deco. Soaring arches that disappear into fog.
*   **Audio**:
    *   *Ambience*: Distant train whistles (that never arrive), the echo of footsteps on marble, low frequency hum of ventilation.
    *   *Music*: Slow, melancholic cello. Space between notes.
*   **Smell/Touch**:
    *   *Smell*: Ozone, stale coffee, old paper.
    *   *Touch*: Cold stone benches, smooth worn handrails.

## 2. The Iceberg (History)
*   **The Official Story**: "Grand Central Terminal of the Diaspora." The main hub for all arrivals.
*   **The Real History**: It was designed to handle 10 million passengers a day. Ideally. Now it handles stragglers. The "Departures" board has been broken for 200 years (Era 3 Event).
*   **Physical Scars**: The "Ticket Booths" are welded shut. Scratches on the floor from where the "Great Crowd" panicked in Era 2.

## 3. Narrative Ecology
*   **Inhabitants**: Samuel (The Ticketmaster/Janitor). Lost travelers.
*   **Conflict**: Waiting vs. Moving. Everyone wants to leave, but the trains are erratic.
*   **The "Casual Mention"**: "The Schedule" (Everyone references it, but no one has seen a valid one in years).

---

## 4. Interface Lens
*   **Technocrat View**: Notices the failing scheduling algorithms and the structural integrity of the arches.
*   **Naturalist View**: Notices the moss growing in the cracks of the marble and the way the light shifts like a sundial.
