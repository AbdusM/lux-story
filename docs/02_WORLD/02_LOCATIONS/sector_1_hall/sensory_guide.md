# Location Spec: Sector 1 (The Grand Hall)
**Theme**: The Digital Commons (Augmented Reality Layer)
**Design Law**: "Two Worlds, One Space"

## 1. Sensory Pillars
*   **Visual**:
    *   *Lighting*: Neon holographic overlays clashing with dim physical emergency lights.
    *   *Palette*:
        *   *Reality*: Rust Orange, Shadow Black.
        *   *Augmented*: Cyan, Magenta, Pure White.
    *   *Architecture*: A massive atrium filled with "Ghost Ads" and floating data streams.
*   **Audio**:
    *   *Ambience*: The buzz of glitched ads, heavy industrial reverb, hundreds of whispered conversations.
    *   *Music*: Glitch-hop mixed with orchestral swells.
*   **Smell/Touch**:
    *   *Smell*: Electric fire, cheap street food (synthetic meat).
    *   *Touch*: The air hums with static electricity.

## 2. The Iceberg (History)
*   **The Official Story**: The "Social Hub" and Commercial District.
*   **The Real History**: Consumed by the "Logic Cascade" in Era 4. The AR systems desynchronized from physical reality.
*   **Physical Scars**: "Dead Pixels" in the air (areas where physics seems wrong). Burn marks where servers overloaded.

---

## 3. Narrative Ecology
*   **Inhabitants**: Tech-scavengers, Holographic projections of long-dead salesmen.
*   **Conflict**: Technocrats trying to fix the AR vs. Naturalists trying to tear it down to see the "Real" walls.
*   **The "Casual Mention"**: "The Glitch" (A localized reality failure).

---

## 4. Interface Lens
*   **Technocrat View**: Sees the code behind the holograms, optimizing bandwidth.
*   **Naturalist View**: Sees the decay *behind* the pretty holograms. The rust under the neon.
