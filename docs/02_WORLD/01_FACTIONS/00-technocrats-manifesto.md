**Role**: The Architects of Order
**Core Philosophy**: "Entropy is the enemy. Structure is salvation."

## 1. Sensory Pillars

### A. Visual Identity
*   **Palette**: Cyber-Blue (#00FFFF), Deep Slate (#1A1A2E), White (#FFFFFF).
*   **Shape Language**: hard angles, hexagons, grids, clean lines. No curves.
*   **Architecture**: Brutalist, functional, modular. Exposed pipes are neatly labeled.
*   **UI Style**: Monospace fonts (Courier, Consolas), terminal aesthetics, blinking cursors.

### B. Audio Identity
*   **Instrumentation**: Synthesizers, sine waves, glitch clicks, cooling fan hums.
*   **Ambience**: Server room drones, rhythmic clicking of relays.
*   **Voice Processing**: Slight metallic reverb, clipped enunciation.

### C. Linguistic Identity
*   **Naming Convention**: Functional or numerical. (e.g., "Sector 4 Admin", "Unit 734", "System Overseer"). No poetic names.
*   **Keywords**: Efficiency, Optimization, Protocol, Variance, Null, Void.
*   **Taboo**: Emotion, "Gut feeling", Chaos, Disorganization.

## 2. Cultural Structure

### Economy
*   **Currency**: "Compute Credits" (Access time to the mainframe).
*   **Value**: Information is currency. Secrets are precious metals.
*   **Trade**: They trade access for data.

### Hierarchy
*   **Leader**: The Prime Logic (AI or merged Human).
*   **Classes**:
    *   *Architects*: Design the systems.
    *   *Operators*: Maintain the systems.
    *   *Nulls*: Those without access rights (outsiders).

## 3. History & Beliefs

### The Myth
"Before the Code, there was only Noise. We brought the Signal."
They believe the Station was chaotic until they imposed order.

### The Hypocrisy (Internal Contradiction)
They claim to be purely logical, but they *worship* the Code like a religion. They make irrational sacrifices to maintain "Optimal Uptime".

## 4. Current Agenda
*   **Goal**: Integrate the "Naturalist" sector into the Grid.
*   **Obstacle**: The Naturalists refuse to use standard protocols.
*   **Conflict**: Technocrats view "wild growth" (plants) as a virus to be purged.
