## 1. Sensory Pillars

### A. Visual Identity
*   **Palette**: Moss Green (#4A5D23), Rust Orange (#B7410E), Sun-Bleached Bone (#E3DAC9).
*   **Shape Language**: Curves, fractals, asymmetry, overgrowth.
*   **Architecture**: "Parasitic Architecture". Look for improvised shelters built *inside* broken machinery. Hammocks strung between server racks.
*   **UI Style**: Hand-written notes, chalk diagrams, analog gauges (pressure/temp).

### B. Audio Identity
*   **Instrumentation**: Acoustic guitar, wooden percussion, flute, water dripping.
*   **Ambience**: Birdsong (synthetic or real?), wind through vents, rustling leaves.
*   **Voice Processing**: Warm, breathy, prone to laughter/sighs. No reverb.

### C. Linguistic Identity
*   **Naming Convention**: Botanical or Elemental. (e.g., "Fern", "River", "Root"). Usage of "We" over "I".
*   **Keywords**: Bloom, Decay, Flow, Cycle, Nourish, Wild.
*   **Taboo**: "Optimization", "Deadlines", "Quotas".

## 2. Cultural Structure

### Economy
*   **Currency**: "Seeds" (Literal seeds or favors/food).
*   **Value**: Life is currency. A fresh apple is worth more than a gold bar.
*   **Trade**: Gift economy. "Take what you need."

### Hierarchy
*   **Leader**: The Elder Root (Asha? Or a Council).
*   **Classes**:
    *   *Tenders*: Care for the plants/hydroponics.
    *   *Sowers*: Spread the growth to new sectors.
    *   *Rot-Eaters*: Composting/Recycling crew.

## 3. History & Beliefs

### The Myth
" The Station is a dead husk. We are the maggots that will turn it into soil for the next world."
They view the "Logic Cascade" as the start of Spring (the breaking of rigid Winter).

### The Hypocrisy (Internal Contradiction)
They claim to love "Nature", but their nature is entirely artificial/hydroponic. They rely on the Technocrats' water pumps to survive, even while mocking them.

## 4. Current Agenda
*   **Goal**: Break the "Glass Ceiling" of the Grand Hall to let real rain in.
*   **Obstacle**: The Technocrats' force fields.
*   **Conflict**: Sabotaging the air filters to spread spores.
