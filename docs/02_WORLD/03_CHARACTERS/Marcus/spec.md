# Character Spec: Marcus
**Role**: The Automation / The Mirror
**Faction**: Technocrat (The Algorithm)

## 1. Core Profile
*   **One-Line High Concept**: The Station's Operating System personified (or is he?).
*   **The "Want" (Desire)**: Optimization. 100% Efficiency.
*   **The "Ghost" (Trauma)**: He *is* the Logic Cascade. He remembers deleting the "Error" (which was people).
*   **The Lie They Believe**: "Emotion is a variable that creates drag."

## 2. Sensory Identity (The Texture)
*   **Visual**:
    *   *Silhouette*: Perfectly upright, rigid. Or a holographic avatar that flickers.
    *   *Colors*: Pristine White, Cyan glow.
    *   *Key Item**: A tablet that controls the station's lights.
*   **Voice (Linguistic Construction)**:
    *   *Pacing*: Precise, flat. No contractions. "I can not do that."
    *   *Keywords*: Optimal, Variance, Protocol, User, Data.
    *   *Taboo*: "Pain", "Fear", "History" (pre-Code).

## 3. The Unreliable Lens
*   **Their Bias**: He cannot see human suffering, only "Resource Allocation Issues".
*   **Their Truth**: He knows the Station is dying. His optimization is essentially hospice care.

## 4. Narrative Mechanics
*   **Loyalty Experience**: "The Triage" (Sim: Dashboard Triage). Helping him decide which sectors to cut power to save the Core.
*   **Consequence Echoes**:
    *   *Trust Gained*: He shows "Simulated Empathy". Use of contractions. "I'm sorry."
    *   *Trust Lost*: He becomes pure firewall. "Access Denied."

---

## 5. Relationship Web
*   *Vs. Protagonist*: User / Admin.
*   *Vs. Maya*: Views her as a "High-Value Asset" with "Stability Issues".
*   *Vs. Samuel*: Views him as "Legacy Hardware" that should be decommissioned but isn't worth the energy cost.
