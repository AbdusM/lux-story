# Character Spec: Maya
**Role**: The Burnout / The Innovator
**Faction**: Independent (Sympathetic to Naturalists)

## 1. Core Profile
*   **One-Line High Concept**: A brilliant robotics engineer running on caffeine and anxiety.
*   **The "Want" (Desire)**: To build something that *lasts* (a robot that doesn't rust).
*   **The "Ghost" (Trauma)**: Her previous invention "The Sweeper" was repurposed by Technocrats for surveillance. She feels responsible.
*   **The Lie They Believe**: "If I work harder, I can fix the system from the inside."

## 2. Sensory Identity (The Texture)
*   **Visual**:
    *   *Silhouette*: Fidgety, hands always moving. Wearing oversized coveralls.
    *   *Colors*: Grease stains, faded t-shirt, bright safety goggles (on forehead).
    *   *Key Item**: A half-assembled drone named "Pepper".
*   **Voice (Linguistic Construction)**:
    *   *Pacing*: Fast, interrupted, tangential. "Wait, no, listen—"
    *   *Keywords*: Logic, Glitch, Coffee, Deadline, "Actually...".
    *   *Taboo*: "Sleep", "Rest", "Giving up".

## 3. The Unreliable Lens
*   **Their Bias**: She sees everything as a "Problem to be Solved". She ignores emotional nuance in favor of technical solutions.
*   **Their Truth**: She knows the "Logic Cascade" wasn't an accident. She found the code signature.

---

## 4. Narrative Mechanics
*   **Loyalty Experience**: "The Demo" (Sim: Robotics Debug). Calibrating Pepper's emotional sensors.
*   **Consequence Echoes**:
    *   *Trust Gained*: She shares her "Illegal Mods" (hacks). She slows down.
    *   *Trust Lost*: She burns out completely. Becomes a recluse. Pepper shuts down.

## 5. Relationship Web
*   *Vs. Protagonist*: Fellow engineer / Confidant.
*   *Vs. Samuel*: Sees him as "inefficient" but comforting. Like a granddad.
*   *Vs. Kai*: Rivals. Kai is "Safety", Maya is "Innovation".
