## 1. Core Profile

*   **The "Want" (Desire)**: A clean dataset. Significance.
*   **The "Ghost" (Trauma)**: She deleted a "Corrupt File" that turned out to be a plea for help from a lost sector.
*   **The Lie They Believe**: "Outliers are errors."

    *   *Silhouette*: Sharp blazer, glasses always sliding down nose, dual monitors reflecting in eyes.
    *   *Colors*: Stark White, Ice Blue, Chartreuse (Highlight marker).
    *   *Key Item**: A clicker/counter she nervously presses.

## 3. The Unreliable Lens
