*   **The "Want" (Desire)**: Zero accidents. A perfectly predictable world.
*   **The "Ghost" (Trauma)**: Witnessed a structural collapse in Sector 4. Saved no one.
*   **The Lie They Believe**: "If I check the list again, nothing bad will happen."

    *   *Colors*: Safety Orange, High-Vis Vest, Industrial Grey.
    *   *Key Item**: A laser measure tool.
*   **Voice (Linguistic Construction)**:

## 3. The Unreliable Lens
*   **Their Bias**: He sees danger where there is only life. He interprets "Growth" (Naturalists) as "structural compromise".
*   **Their Truth**: He knows the Station's "Bones" are rotting. No amount of inspection can fix the foundation.
