# Character Spec: Nadia Khoury
**Role**: The Reflective Technologist
**Animal**: Barn Owl
**Career**: AI Strategist
**Tier**: Secondary (LinkedIn 2026 Expansion)

---

## 1. Core Profile
*   **One-Line High Concept**: AI strategist who left big tech to ensure algorithmic systems serve humanity instead of extracting from it
*   **The "Want" (Desire)**: To prove AI can be built with wisdom, not just intelligence
*   **The "Ghost" (Trauma)**: Watched her optimization algorithms inadvertently harm vulnerable communities
*   **The Lie They Believe**: That if she thinks hard enough, she can design systems that are purely neutral

---

## 2. Sensory Identity (The Texture)
*   **Visual**:
    *   *Silhouette*: Still, observant—moves with deliberate precision like processing information
    *   *Colors*: Cool silvers and deep indigos (night owl aesthetic)
    *   *Key Item*: An old mechanical calculator representing pre-digital logic
*   **Voice (Linguistic Construction)**:
    *   *Pacing*: Measured pauses—chooses words like optimizing an algorithm
    *   *Keywords*: "systems", "optimize", "unintended consequences", "bias in logic", "wisdom vs. intelligence"
    *   *Taboo*: Refuses to discuss specific algorithms that caused harm or her exact role in their deployment

---

## 3. The Unreliable Lens
*   **Their Bias**: Believes all problems are solvable through better system design; underestimates human irrationality
*   **Their Truth**: Every algorithm contains the biases of its creator—"neutral" systems are a myth

---

## 4. Narrative Mechanics
*   **Loyalty Experience**: Player works with Nadia to debug a decision-making system that produces unintended harm, learning to spot hidden biases
*   **Consequence Echoes**:
    *   *Trust Gained*: Shares vulnerability about algorithms she designed that hurt people; discusses ethical weight of optimization
    *   *Trust Lost*: Retreats into pure logic mode; treats human problems as mere data points

---

## 5. Relationship Web
*   *Vs. Protagonist*: Mentor who teaches player to see invisible systems shaping choices
*   *Vs. Quinn*: Collaborative—both analyze systems, but Quinn focuses on financial while Nadia focuses on algorithmic
*   *Vs. Dante*: Cautious—Nadia reads data patterns while Dante reads emotional patterns
*   *Vs. Rohan*: Kindred spirits—both left tech seeking deeper purpose

---

## 6. Pattern Affinities
*   **Primary Pattern**: Analytical (AI strategy requires systematic thinking)
*   **Secondary Pattern**: Patience (good algorithms take time to build responsibly)
*   **Anti-Pattern**: Building (focuses on optimization over creation)

---

## 7. Dialogue Themes
*   Algorithmic bias and unintended consequences
*   Wisdom vs. intelligence in system design
*   Leaving big tech for ethical work
*   The myth of neutral technology
*   Hidden systems that shape human choice
*   Optimization vs. human values

---

## 8. Trust Progression (10 levels)
*   **Trust 0-2**: Professional, focused on AI strategy basics
*   **Trust 3-4**: Begins to discuss ethical AI and bias in algorithms
*   **Trust 5**: Shares philosophy that "neutral systems" are impossible
*   **Trust 6-7**: Opens up about specific algorithms that caused harm
*   **Trust 8-9**: Reveals deep guilt and responsibility for system impacts
*   **Trust 10**: Invites player to co-design ethical AI frameworks

---

## 9. Simulation Scenario
**The Hidden Bias**: Player must design a decision-making system (e.g., hiring algorithm, loan approval). Nadia reveals how seemingly logical rules can encode unfair biases. The simulation shows cascading consequences of optimization without wisdom.

**Mechanics**:
- Player builds rules that seem fair but create unintended patterns
- Nadia highlights second and third-order effects
- Choices reflect analytical rigor vs. value-centered design

**Document Control**: Created January 2026 for comprehensive repository cleanup
