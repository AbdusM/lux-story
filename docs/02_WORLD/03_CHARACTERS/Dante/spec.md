## 1. Core Profile
*   **One-Line High Concept**: Master salesperson who discovered that connection sells better than manipulation, but still struggles with the performance vs. authenticity divide
*   **The "Want" (Desire)**: To prove that ethical sales exists—that you can win without weaponizing trust
*   **The "Ghost" (Trauma)**: Burned out from years of high-pressure sales where success meant becoming someone else entirely
*   **The Lie They Believe**: That being authentic means giving up competitive edge

## 2. Sensory Identity (The Texture)
*   **Visual**:
    *   *Silhouette*: Dynamic, expansive—takes up space with natural charisma
    *   *Colors*: Bold jewel tones—emerald greens, sapphire blues (peacock vibrancy)
    *   *Key Item*: A vintage microphone representing the performance aspect of sales
*   **Voice (Linguistic Construction)**:
    *   *Pacing*: Energetic bursts with strategic pauses for emphasis
    *   *Keywords*: "connection", "story", "performance", "authentic edge", "strategic vulnerability"
    *   *Taboo*: Refuses to discuss specific manipulation tactics or clients they feel guilty about

---

## 3. The Unreliable Lens
*   **Their Bias**: Sees every interaction as a potential sale; constantly reading people for "buying signals"
*   **Their Truth**: People don't buy products—they buy stories about who they'll become after the purchase

---

## 4. Narrative Mechanics
*   **Loyalty Experience**: Player role-plays a pitch scenario where Dante teaches them to read audience signals and adapt messaging in real-time
*   **Consequence Echoes**:
    *   *Trust Gained*: Drops the performance mask; shares vulnerability about identity crisis in sales
    *   *Trust Lost*: Retreats into pure performance mode; everything becomes a pitch, nothing feels real

---

## 5. Relationship Web
*   *Vs. Protagonist*: Mentor who challenges player to find their authentic communication style
*   *Vs. Quinn*: Respectful tension—Dante values perception management; Quinn values substance
*   *Vs. Nadia*: Cautious respect—both strategists, but Dante reads emotions while Nadia reads data
*   *Vs. Isaiah*: Admiration—Isaiah represents the authentic leadership Dante aspires to

---

## 6. Pattern Affinities
*   **Primary Pattern**: Helping (sales is about understanding and meeting needs)
*   **Secondary Pattern**: Analytical (strategic thinking about messaging and positioning)
*   **Anti-Pattern**: Patience (sales is about momentum; hesitation loses deals)

---

## 7. Dialogue Themes
*   Performance vs. authenticity in professional identity
*   Ethical persuasion vs. manipulation
*   Reading people and adapting communication

---

## 8. Trust Progression (10 levels)

## 9. Simulation Scenario
**The Authentic Pitch**: Player must pitch an idea to a skeptical audience. Dante guides them through reading social cues, adapting messaging, and finding the balance between strategy and authenticity. The simulation adapts to whether player leans on performance skills or genuine connection.

**Mechanics**:
- Player chooses between scripted vs. improvised approaches
- Audience reaction changes based on perceived authenticity
- Dante's coaching reveals their own struggle with performance identity
