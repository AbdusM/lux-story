# Archive Index

Last updated: 2026-02-11

## Purpose

`docs/03_PROCESS/archive/` stores historical, superseded, and session-specific materials.
Nothing here is considered canonical for current implementation unless explicitly referenced.

## Active Sources of Truth

Use these for current work instead of archived files:

- Process hub: `docs/03_PROCESS/00-readme.md`
- Testing and quality gates: `docs/03_PROCESS/01-testing.md`
- Delivery methodology: `docs/03_PROCESS/02-methodology.md`
- Document control policy: `docs/03_PROCESS/03-document-control.md`
- Root documentation map: `docs/README.md`

## Archive Categories

- Date/sprint folders (`13DEC_sprint`, `14DEC_sprint`, `JAN2026_sprint`, etc.)
- Legacy prompt/handover materials
- Historical reports and test artifacts
- Superseded process docs (`95+` prefixed files)

## Usage Rules

- Do not treat archived docs as implementation requirements without validating against active docs.
- Prefer copying useful excerpts into active docs instead of editing historical files.
- Keep newly superseded files in this folder with explicit `superseded` naming.

## Depth Policy

- Active docs aim for depth <= 3.
- Deep paths in archive are accepted as legacy preservation zones.
