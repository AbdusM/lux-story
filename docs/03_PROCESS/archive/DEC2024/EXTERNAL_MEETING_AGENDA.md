# External Team Meeting Agenda: Grand Central Terminus

**Objective:** Demonstrate product maturity, validate technical depth, and align on strategic direction.
**Key Documents:** `STAKEHOLDER_OVERVIEW.md`, `CHARACTER_STYLES_REFERENCE.md`, `STRATEGIC_ROADMAP_BASELINE_TO_LONGTERM.md`

---

## 1. The Vision & The "Why" (5-10 mins)
*Reference: `STAKEHOLDER_OVERVIEW.md`*

*   **The Problem:** Traditional career tools are abstract, passive, and boring ("Rate these statements 1-5").
*   **The Solution:** An immersive narrative game where identity emerges from choice.
*   **Key Talking Points:**
    *   **"Show, Don't Tell":** We don't ask "Are you analytical?"; we see if players choose to analyze the station's architecture.
    *   **Differentiation:** Emotional investment + Replay value (vs. LinkedIn Learning/Handshake).
    *   **Target Market:** Birmingham Youth (14-24) primarily, but scalable.

## 2. The Product & The "What" (10-15 mins)
*Reference: `STAKEHOLDER_OVERVIEW.md` (Metrics) & Demo*

*   **Production Readiness:**
    *   **Scale:** 20 Characters, 1,431 nodes, 2,551 choices.
    *   **Quality:** 212k lines of TypeScript, 1,000+ tests, Mobile-first.
*   **Core Mechanics to Highlight:**
    *   **Dialogue Engine:** It's not a decision tree; it's a state machine with trust, memory, and consequences.
    *   **Pattern Discovery:** The 5 patterns (Analytical, Patience, Exploring, Helping, Building).

## 3. The Depth & The "Soul" (10-15 mins)
*Reference: `CHARACTER_STYLES_REFERENCE.md`*

*   **Character Roster:** It's not just "The Nurse" and "The Engineer". It's:
    *   **Marcus (Bear):** The burned-out medical tech finding repurpose.
    *   **Maya (Cat):** The restless innovator fighting expectations.
*   **Technical Nuance:**
    *   **Typing Styles:** Explain how Maya (500ms) *feels* different from Samuel (1000ms).
    *   **Voice System:** How the game speaks back to you based on *your* pattern (178 voice variations).

## 4. The Future & The Decision (10 mins)
*Reference: `STRATEGIC_ROADMAP_BASELINE_TO_LONGTERM.md`*

*   **Current State:** Baseline Complete (AAA foundation).
*   **The Crossroads:**
    *   **Path A (Indie Game):** Steam/Itch.io launch. Focus on narrative fans.
    *   **Path B (B2B Tool):** Workforce development pilot (Urban Chamber). Focus on educational value.
*   **Ask for Guidance:** "Given the depth we've built, which path maximizes our impact vs. risk profile?"
