# Lux Story - Educator Guide
**For Urban Chamber Pilot - January 2025**

---

## What is Lux Story?

Lux Story is a narrative-driven game where players explore career paths and identity through conversations with characters at a mysterious train station. Unlike traditional career assessments, it reveals who players are **becoming** through the choices they make, not through questions they answer.

**Think of it as:** The dialogue depth of a video game (Pokemon, Disco Elysium) meets career exploration through behavioral pattern recognition.

---

## How It Works (5-Minute Overview)

### The Core Loop:
1. **Meet Characters** - Each represents a different career path or life crossroads
2. **Make Choices** - Every response reveals behavioral patterns (not "right" vs "wrong")
3. **Discover Patterns** - 5 patterns emerge: Analytical, Patience, Exploring, Helping, Building
4. **Unlock Abilities** - As patterns strengthen, new dialogue options and insights unlock
5. **Reflect on Journey** - Patterns reveal natural inclinations and potential career fits

### Time Commitment:
- **Per session:** 5-10 minutes (mobile-friendly, built for short bursts)
- **Total for meaningful experience:** 2-3 hours over 1-2 weeks
- **Progress auto-saves** - players can pause/resume anytime

## The 5 Behavioral Patterns

These aren't personality types or career categories—they're **lenses** for how someone approaches challenges.

| Pattern | What It Reveals | Career Examples | Unlock Benefits |
|---------|----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Analytical** 🔬 | Thinks through problems logically, seeks data and frameworks | Systems analyst, researcher, engineer | See subtext hints, pattern recognition |
| **Patience** ⏳ | Takes time to listen deeply, waits for the right moment | Therapist, mediator, strategist | "Wait and observe" options unlock |
| **Exploring** 🔍 | Asks questions, discovers connections, follows curiosity | Journalist, scientist, entrepreneur | Extra worldbuilding details, hidden paths |
| **Helping** 💗 | Supports others, reads emotional needs, builds connection | Teacher, nurse, social worker | See character emotions, deeper empathy |
| **Building** 🏗️ | Takes action, makes decisions, creates tangible results | Product manager, architect, organizer | Decisive action options, shape outcomes |

**IMPORTANT:** Most people have 2-3 dominant patterns, not just one. The mix matters more than the individual score.

## Facilitating the Experience

### Before They Play

**Frame it correctly** - This is NOT:
- A test with right/wrong answers
- A personality quiz
- A linear story (everyone's path is different)
- Career advice (it's career **exploration**)

**Frame it as:**
- An interactive story that reveals who you're becoming
- A mirror for your natural inclinations
- A safe space to try different approaches and see what feels authentic

**Set expectations:**
- Sessions are 5-10 minutes (designed for phone breaks)
- Full experience takes 2-3 hours total over 1-2 weeks
- There's no "completion" - explore what interests you
- Your choices create your unique story

### During the Pilot (1-2 Weeks)

**Check-ins (Optional):**
- Day 3: "Have you started? What character did you meet first?"
- Day 7: "What patterns are emerging for you?"
- Day 14: "What surprised you about your choices?"

**Encourage reflection:**
- Which character's story resonated most?
- Did any choices feel difficult? Why?
- What patterns are you seeing in yourself?

**DON'T:**
- Pressure completion ("You need to finish all 11 characters")
- Judge pattern distribution ("You should have more Helping")
- Compare participants ("Sarah has more Analytical than you")

### After They Play (Group Debrief)

**Debrief Format (60-90 minutes):**

**Part 1: Individual Reflection (15 min)**
- "What character stood out to you? Why?"
- "What patterns emerged for you?"
- "Did anything surprise you about your own choices?"

**Part 2: Pattern Discussion (30 min)**
- Show anonymized cohort pattern distribution (from dashboard)
- "What do these patterns tell us about our group?"
- "How might these patterns show up in career choices?"
- "Can you think of careers that need a mix of patterns?"

**Part 3: Career Connections (30 min)**
- "Based on your patterns, what careers feel aligned?"
- "What careers challenge your patterns (in a good way)?"
- "What's one new career path you're curious about now?"

**Part 4: Next Steps (15 min)**
- "What's one thing you want to explore further?"
- "How might you test these patterns in real life?"

## Using the Admin Dashboard

**What You'll See:**

### Pattern Distribution
- Bar chart showing cohort-wide pattern scores
- Identifies group strengths (e.g., "High Helping + Building = Service-oriented builders")
- Reveals gaps (e.g., "Low Analytical = May need systems thinking support")

### Completion Metrics
- How many participants started vs. finished
- Average time spent per character
- Drop-off points (where players stopped)

### Character Engagement
- Which characters resonated most
- Completion rate by character arc
- Time spent per character

**How to Interpret:**

**High Analytical + Patience:** Thoughtful problem-solvers, good for research/strategy roles
**High Helping + Building:** Action-oriented caregivers, good for healthcare/education leadership
**High Exploring + Analytical:** Systems thinkers who ask "why?", good for innovation/R&D

**Red Flags:**
- Very low engagement (< 15 min total) = Didn't connect with format
- Extremely unbalanced patterns (95% one pattern) = May have "gamed" it
- High drop-off rate = Experience needs refinement

## FAQs from Participants

**Q: "Is there a right way to play?"**
A: No. The game adapts to your choices. There's no optimal path—only your path.

**Q: "Can I go back and change my answers?"**
A: The game doesn't let you undo choices (like real life). But you can always start a new conversation with the same character.

**Q: "What if I don't like my patterns?"**
A: Patterns aren't labels—they're observations. They show tendencies, not limits. Everyone has all 5 patterns; it's about which ones you lean into naturally.

**Q: "How do patterns relate to careers?"**
A: They're not 1:1 mappings (Analytical ≠ Engineer). Instead, think about which careers **reward** your natural patterns. A teacher might be high Helping + Patience. An ER nurse might be high Helping + Building.

**Q: "I'm stuck/confused—what do I do?"**
A: Check the Journal (side panel) to see your patterns and unlocks. If truly stuck, reach out to [your contact method].

## Success Criteria for Pilot

### Engagement Metrics (Quantitative):
- **Target completion rate:** 70%+ finish at least 2 character arcs
- **Target time:** 1-2 hours average playtime
- **Pattern diversity:** Participants discover at least 3 of the 5 patterns

### Insight Metrics (Qualitative):
- Participants can articulate their dominant patterns
- At least 50% discover a career interest they hadn't considered
- Feedback includes specific examples of self-recognition ("I never realized I do that")

### Debrief Engagement:
- Participants actively discuss patterns in group setting
- Connect patterns to real career examples
- Express interest in exploring patterns further

## Troubleshooting

**"Nobody is engaging"**
- Check: Did you frame it as optional exploration vs. required assignment?
- Check: Are they playing on mobile (where it's designed to work best)?
- Check: Did you set realistic time expectations (not "finish everything")?

**"Participants say it's too long"**
- Clarify: It's 5-10 min per session, not all at once
- Reframe: It's like watching a Netflix series—episode by episode, not binge

**"Dashboard shows weird data"**
- Contact [developer] immediately
- Screenshot the issue
- Note which participant (anonymized ID) shows anomaly

**"Participants asking about career advice"**
- Redirect: "The game shows patterns, not prescriptions"
- Encourage: "Based on your patterns, what careers are YOU curious about?"
- Don't: Give definitive career recommendations based solely on patterns
