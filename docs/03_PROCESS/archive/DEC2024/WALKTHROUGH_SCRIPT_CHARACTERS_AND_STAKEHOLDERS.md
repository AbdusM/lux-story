**Context:** Use this script when presenting `STAKEHOLDER_OVERVIEW.md` and `CHARACTER_STYLES_REFERENCE.md` side-by-side.

## Part 1: The High-Level Pitch (The "Why")
*Source: `STAKEHOLDER_OVERVIEW.md`*

**Opening Hook:**
"We're solving the engagement problem in career exploration. Most tools ask youth to 'rate themselves' on a scale. We ask them to step into a living world."

**The Metrics (The "What"):**
"This isn't a prototype. It's a production-ready platform."
*   **Scale:** "We have **20 fully realized characters**, not just generic avatars."
*   **Depth:** "**1,431 unique dialogue nodes** creating a branching narrative."
*   **Behavioral Data:** "**2,551 meaningful choices** that map to 5 authentic behavioral patterns."

**Transition:**
"But numbers don't explain why players care. Let me show you the soul of the system."

## Part 2: The Character Deep Dive (The "How")
*Source: `CHARACTER_STYLES_REFERENCE.md`*

**The Roster:**
"We've built a cast that represents the real complexity of the workforce."
*   *Point to `STAKEHOLDER_OVERVIEW.md` (Table):* "We cover Technology, Healthcare, Finance, and Social Impact."
*   *Switch to `CHARACTER_STYLES_REFERENCE.md` (Roster):* "But look at **how** we represent them."

**Example 1: Marcus (The Bear)**
"Marcus isn't just 'The Healthcare Worker.' He's a burnout survivor finding new purpose in medical tech."
*   **Symbolism:** "The Bear represents strength and protection."
*   **Typing Style:** "His text appears at **900ms** intervals—measured, careful, steady. You *feel* his patience before you even read the words."

**Example 2: Maya (The Cat)**
"Contrast that with Maya, our Tech Innovator."
*   **Symbolism:** "The Cat—curious, independent, maybe a bit aloof."
*   **Typing Style:** "She types at **500ms**—restless, efficient. She interrupts herself. It feels like chatting with a brilliant but impatient founder."

**The Voice System:**
"The system listens to the player. If you play as an **Analytical** thinker, the characters change how they talk to you."
*   *Reference `CHARACTER_STYLES_REFERENCE.md` (Voice Variation):* "A 'Helping' player hears Marcus ask 'How do you feel?'. An 'Analytical' player hears him say 'The data suggests...'."

## Part 3: The Market & Future (The "Now")
*Source: `STAKEHOLDER_OVERVIEW.md`*

**The Competitive Edge:**
"Unlike LinkedIn Learning (passive video) or Handshake (job matching), we offer **Emergent Identity**. We don't tell you who you are; you discover it."

**The Ask/Decision:**
"We have a choice to make on our Roadmap."
*   "Do we double down on the **Education Market** (B2B pilot in Birmingham)?"
*   "Or do we launch as a **Narrative Game** (Steam/Itch.io)?"

"The technology is ready for either. The depth of these 20 characters supports both deep educational discovery *and* high-quality entertainment."
