**Purpose:** Comprehensive reference guide for CEO presentation walkthrough  
**Date:** November 2025  
**Document Status:** Ready for Presentation

---

## Opening Statement

### Primary Opening (30 seconds)
**"We're solving the skills gap problem differently - through narrative, not assessments. Let me show you how it works."**

---

## Section 1: The Student Experience

### 1.1. Playing the Experience
**What to Show:** Play through Maya's introduction scene
- Demonstrate dialogue and choices
- Show ChatPacedDialogue in action
- Make a choice and see the story branch

**Talking Point:**
**"This is what students experience - narrative-driven career exploration."**

**Extended Script (2 minutes):**
**"This is what a student sees. Let's play through Maya's story..."**

---

## Section 2: The Technical Foundation

### 2.1. Choice-to-Skills Mapping
**Talking Point:**
**"Every choice is annotated with real skills. This supportive response is aligned with emotional intelligence and communication - we track that automatically."**

**Extended Script (1 minute):**
**"Under the hood, every choice is structured data. Here's how we define choices with skills metadata..."**

### 2.2. Data Structure
**Talking Point:**
**"This is the structure that drives everything. Each choice has skills metadata, behavior patterns, and story consequences."**

### 2.3. Real-Time Skill Tracking
**Talking Point:**
**"When they click a choice, we immediately record which skills their choice is aligned with. This happens in real-time, building their profile automatically."**

**Extended Script (1 minute):**
**"When they make a choice, we immediately track it. This happens in real-time..."**

### 2.4. The Tracking Engine
**Talking Point:**
**"This is the engine that builds their profile. Every choice becomes evidence of skills aligned with their choices. No surveys, no self-reporting - pure behavioral tracking."**

---

## Section 3: The Admin Dashboard

### 3.1. Dashboard Overview
**Talking Point:**
**"This is what counselors see. Real-time insights on each student - their skills, career matches, and where they need support. We've built this as a modular Next.js App Router architecture so each section can be independently maintained and optimized. Actionable data, not just reports."**

**Extended Script (2 minutes):**
**"And this is what counselors see. We start at the student list showing character relationships and choice patterns. When you click into a student, you get a modular dashboard with 6 sections - Urgency, Skills, Careers, Evidence, Gaps, and Action. Each section is its own route, so you can deep-link to specific insights. Real-time data, career matches, actionable recommendations..."**

### 3.2. Dashboard Architecture
**Key Talking Points:**
- **Modular Architecture:** Each section is a standalone component (200-400 lines vs old 2,545-line monolith)
- **Deep Linking:** Shareable URLs to specific sections (`/admin/user123/careers`)
- **Performance:** Only loads active section, not all tabs
- **Maintainability:** Separation of concerns with independently maintained sections

---

## Section 4: WEF 2030 Skills Framework

### 4.1. Framework Overview
**Context:**
The World Economic Forum's 2030 Skills Framework (WEF, 2023) represents the most comprehensive analysis of future workforce needs, based on:
- 803 million job postings analyzed
- 11,000 tasks across 673 occupations
- 803 companies surveyed across 27 industry clusters

**Key Insight:** 50% of all employees will need reskilling by 2025, with analytical thinking, creative thinking, and resilience topping employer priority lists.

### 4.2. Skill Tracking
**Talking Point:**
**"Every choice a student makes is automatically tagged with the WEF 2030 skills they're aligned with. For example, when a student chooses to help Maya work through her robotics decision, that choice is aligned with emotional intelligence, communication, and collaboration - three critical 2030 skills that employers are actively seeking."**

### 4.3. Skill-to-Career Matching
**Talking Point:**
**"We don't just track skills - we connect them to actual Birmingham career opportunities. When a student's choices show alignment with emotional intelligence and problem solving, we show them healthcare technology roles at UAB, Children's Hospital, or Innovation Depot. The skills framework isn't theoretical - it's tied directly to local jobs."**

### 4.4. Research Foundation
**Talking Point:**
**"This isn't just a game - it's grounded in peer-reviewed research. The World Economic Forum's framework tells us what skills matter. Erikson's theory explains why career identity exploration is critical for adolescents. And our evidence-based approach tracks choices aligned with skills, not just what students say about themselves."**

**Supporting Frameworks:**
- Holland's RIASEC Career Theory (personality-career fit)
- Erikson's Identity Development (adolescent career identity formation)
- Social Cognitive Career Theory (self-efficacy building)
- Evidence-Based Assessment (performance vs. self-report)

## Section 5: Beyond Skills - Holistic Tracking

### 5.1. Choice Patterns (Personality Indicators)
**Talking Point:**
**"We don't just track what skills they show - we track how they show them. Are they naturally helping-oriented? Analytical? Patient? These patterns reveal their personality type, which we then match to careers using Holland's RIASEC theory."**

**The Five Patterns:**
- **Helping** → Demonstrates emotional intelligence, collaboration, communication
- **Analytical** → Demonstrates critical thinking, problem solving, digital literacy
- **Building** → Demonstrates creativity, problem solving, leadership
- **Patience** → Demonstrates time management, adaptability, emotional intelligence
- **Exploring** → Demonstrates adaptability, creativity, critical thinking

### 5.2. Character Relationships (Social-Emotional Learning)
**Talking Point:**
**"Trust is earned through consistent choices. When a student helps Maya navigate her robotics decision empathetically, Maya's trust goes from 0 to 6, unlocking deeper conversations. This mirrors real workplace relationship building and shows alignment with emotional intelligence."**

**Characters:**
- **Maya Chen:** Medical school vs robotics passion (identity conflict)
- **Devon Kumar:** Technical introvert working through grief
- **Jordan Packard:** Impostor syndrome, multiple job changes
- **Samuel:** Station guide, wise mentor figure

### 5.3. Career Matching System
**Talking Point:**
**"We don't just match skills to careers - we match to actual Birmingham jobs. When a student shows strong emotional intelligence and problem solving, we show them healthcare technology roles at UAB Hospital, which is walkable from many neighborhoods. Local = actionable."**

**Matching Factors:**
- Skills Indicated by Choices: Which WEF 2030 skills are most aligned with their choices
- Choice Patterns: Personality alignment (RIASEC theory)
- Birmingham Opportunities: Local employers (UAB, Children's Hospital, Innovation Depot)
- Readiness Score: near_ready (80%+) | developing (40-79%) | exploring (<40%)

### 5.4. The Six Evidence Frameworks
**Talking Point:**
**"This isn't just one framework - it's six interlocking evidence systems. Skills show capability. Patterns show personality. Relationships show social-emotional development. Engagement shows commitment. Together, they paint a complete picture of who this student is and where they're headed."**

**The Six Frameworks:**
1. **Skill Development Evidence** - Concrete evidence of capability development
2. **Career Readiness** - Career pathway discovery and readiness assessment
3. **Decision Patterns** - Understanding decision-making style and reliability
4. **Engagement Journey** - Measuring sustained engagement and commitment
5. **Relationships Framework** - Social-emotional learning assessment
6. **Learning Style (Behavioral Consistency)** - Understanding learning and engagement preferences

### 5.5. Breakthrough Moments
**Talking Point:**
**"We track the breakthrough moments - when Maya admits her robotics passion conflicts with family expectations, when Devon shares his flowchart for talking to his dad. These aren't just story beats - they're evidence of choices aligned with emotional intelligence, trust-building, and authentic relationship development."**

**Three Types:**
- Vulnerability Moments: When characters share personal struggles
- Decision Moments: When students help characters make critical choices
- Mutual Recognition: When trust is fully established (confidant level)

### 5.6. Holistic Portrait
**Talking Point:**
**"We're not building a skills tracker - we're building a complete portrait. Skills tell us what they can do. Patterns tell us who they are. Relationships tell us how they connect. Engagement tells us how committed they are. Together, these create a holistic view that counselors can use to provide truly personalized support."**
