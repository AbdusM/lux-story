# Welcome to Lux Story 🚉

**You're about to explore a train station between who you were and who you're becoming.**

---

## What is this?

Lux Story is an interactive story game where you meet characters figuring out their paths—just like you. Your choices reveal patterns about how you approach life, which can help you understand career paths that might fit you naturally.

**This is NOT:**
- A test (there are no right or wrong answers)
- A quiz that tells you what to do
- Something you have to "complete"

**This IS:**
- An exploration of who you're becoming
- A mirror for your natural patterns
- A story that changes based on your choices

You approach problems with logic. You ask "why?" and look for systems.
- **Careers that reward this:** Engineering, research, data analysis, strategy

### ⏳ **Patience** - "Let me listen first"
You take time to understand before acting. You value depth over speed.
- **Careers that reward this:** Therapy, mediation, teaching, mentoring

### 🔍 **Exploring** - "What if...?"
You're curious. You ask questions, follow threads, discover connections.

## Tips for Getting the Most Out of This

### ✅ DO:
- **Choose what feels authentic** - not what sounds "good"
- **Read the Journal** - see what patterns are emerging
- **Explore different characters** - each offers a different perspective
- **Take breaks** - this is designed for short sessions
- **Ask "why did I choose that?"** - the reflection is where the learning happens

### ❌ DON'T:
- Try to "game" the system (it adapts to YOU, not an ideal profile)
- Rush through to "complete" it (there's no finish line)
- Stress about your patterns (they're observations, not judgments)
- Compare yourself to others (everyone's journey is different)

## FAQs

**Q: How long will this take?**
A: A meaningful experience is 1-2 hours total, but you can spread that across a week or two. Play in 5-10 minute chunks whenever you have time.

**Q: Can I change my answers?**
A: The game doesn't let you undo choices (like real life doesn't). But if you want to explore a different path, you can always talk to the same character again later—the conversation will adapt.

**Q: What if I don't like my patterns?**
A: Patterns show tendencies, not limits. Having low "Analytical" doesn't mean you CAN'T be an engineer—it means you might approach engineering differently (maybe more creatively or collaboratively). Your mix of patterns is what makes you unique.

**Q: Is there a "best" way to play?**
A: Nope. The game responds to YOUR choices. The "best" way is the most authentic way—choose what feels true to you.

**Q: Will this tell me what career I should choose?**
A: No. It shows you patterns about how you approach situations. YOU make the connection to careers. Think of it as a mirror, not a roadmap.

**Q: Can I play more than once?**
A: Yes! Your first playthrough reveals your initial patterns. Playing again with different choices can show you other sides of yourself.

**Q: I'm stuck/confused—what do I do?**
A: Check the **Journal** (button on the side) to see where you are in your journey. If you're still stuck, reach out to [contact person/method].
