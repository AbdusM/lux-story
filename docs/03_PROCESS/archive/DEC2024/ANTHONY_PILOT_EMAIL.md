**Subject:** Lux Story Pilot - Confirmation & Timeline Discussion

---

Hi Anthony,

I hope this email finds you well!

I wanted to reach out regarding the Lux Story pilot we discussed for your 16 Birmingham graduates. Before we finalize logistics, I have a few questions to ensure we're aligned on timeline and expectations.

## Proposed Timeline

I had originally been targeting **December 21-24** for the pilot, but after reviewing what's needed to ensure a successful experience, I'd like to propose **pushing to January 2025** instead.

Here's why this would serve your graduates better:

### What's Ready Now ✅
- Full game with 11 character arcs (16,763 dialogue lines)
- Pattern tracking system (5 behavioral patterns: analytical, patience, exploring, helping, building)
- Identity agency mechanics
- Mobile-optimized design (430 kB bundle, 1.5-3s load on 4G)
- Admin dashboard for cohort analytics
- Error boundaries for crash recovery
- Onboarding screen explaining game mechanics

### What Needs 2-3 More Weeks ⏳
- **Educator materials** - Guide for facilitating debriefs, interpreting pattern data
- **Student instructions** - Clear onboarding for participants
- **Success metrics definition** - Agreed-upon KPIs to measure pilot effectiveness
- **Birmingham beta testing** - Testing with 1-2 local teens BEFORE the full cohort
- **Pilot analytics refinement** - Ensure dashboard shows metrics you actually need

## Questions for You

Before we proceed, I'd love to get your input on a few things:

1. **Timing**: Would a **mid-to-late January 2025** pilot work for you and the graduates? This gives us time to polish the experience and create proper support materials.

2. **Budget**: We previously discussed $5,000-10,000 for the pilot. Is this still aligned with your expectations? What's included in your mind?

3. **Deliverables**: What would "success" look like for you? For example:
   - Completion rate (% of graduates who finish at least 1-2 character arcs)?
   - Qualitative feedback (did participants find it valuable)?
   - Career insights (did they discover new career interests)?
   - Pattern distribution (what behavioral patterns emerged across the cohort)?

4. **Availability**: Are the 16 graduates available in January? Any scheduling preferences or constraints?

5. **Format**: How were you envisioning this working logistically?
   - Self-paced (each graduate plays on their own time over 1-2 weeks)?
   - Facilitated sessions (gather for group discussion/debrief)?
   - Hybrid (independent play + group reflection)?

## What You'll Receive

If we move forward with a January pilot, here's what I'll provide:

### For Graduates:
- Access link to Lux Story
- Student onboarding guide (what to expect, how patterns work)
- Mobile-friendly experience (works on any device)
- Progress auto-saves (can pause/resume anytime)

### For You (Educator/Organizer):
- Educator guide (how to introduce the game, facilitate debriefs)
- Admin dashboard access (view cohort-wide pattern data)
- Post-pilot analytics report:
  - Pattern distribution across participants
  - Completion rates
  - Time spent per character
  - Qualitative themes from participant feedback
- 1-hour debrief call to discuss findings

### Timeline:
- **Week 1-2 (Jan 6-17)**: Graduates play independently
- **Week 3 (Jan 20-24)**: Optional group debrief/reflection
- **Week 4 (Jan 27-31)**: Analytics report delivery + debrief call with you

## Alternative: December Mini-Pilot

If January doesn't work and you need something in December, I can offer a **scaled-down version**:

- **Scope**: Samuel intro + 1-2 character arcs (instead of full 11 characters)
- **Focus**: Test narrative engagement, not full pattern system
- **Purpose**: Learning pilot (gather feedback for January full launch)
- **Timeline**: Dec 21-24 would be feasible for this reduced scope

This would be a "soft launch" to validate the concept, with the full experience rolling out in January.

## Next Steps

Let me know which option works better for you:

**Option A**: January 2025 full pilot (recommended)
**Option B**: December mini-pilot (scaled-down, feedback-focused)

Either way, I'm excited to get this in front of your graduates. The feedback from real Birmingham youth will be invaluable for refining the experience.

Looking forward to hearing from you!

Best,
[Your Name]

## Notes for Yourself (Delete before sending)

**Red Flags to Watch For:**
- If Anthony says "I need it in December no matter what" → Ask why the urgency, what's driving the timeline
- If budget is unclear → Clarify before starting work
- If success metrics are vague → Push for specifics ("Can you give me 3 concrete outcomes you'd consider success?")

**If He's Not Responsive:**
- This might mean the pilot isn't happening
- Don't build more features assuming it will
- Wait for confirmation before investing more time

**Critical:**
- DO NOT start building pilot-specific features until you have:
  1. Confirmed timeline
  2. Agreed budget
  3. Defined success metrics
  4. Confirmed participant availability
