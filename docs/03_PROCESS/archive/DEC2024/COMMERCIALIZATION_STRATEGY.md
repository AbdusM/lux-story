# Lux Story: Commercialization Strategy for Steam (2026)

**Date:** December 2025  
**Goal:** Transform Lux Story into a commercial Steam game following the indie game "Great Conjunction" roadmap

---

## 🎯 Executive Summary

**Current State:** Contemplative career exploration platform with narrative engine, skill tracking, and adaptive storytelling.

**Recommended Strategy:** **Web-first launch** → Validate traction → Steam launch with proven demand

**Why Web First:**

- Faster to market (deploy today)
- Build audience before Steam
- Validate concept before investing
- Easier iteration and feedback

**Timeline (Web-First Approach):**
1. **Month 1:** Launch on web + itch.io (free)
2. **Month 2-3:** Build audience, gather feedback, iterate
3. **Month 3-4:** Create Steam page, drive wishlists from web audience
4. **Month 4-6:** Launch on Steam with 1,000+ wishlists from web players

**Alternative (Direct to Steam):** 6-8 months to Steam release following the roadmap:
1. **2-4 months:** Build polished demo
2. **1-2 months:** Steam page + TikTok marketing
3. **1 month:** Demo launch event
4. **3-4 months:** Content creation + wishlist building
5. **Release:** When 10,000+ wishlists achieved
