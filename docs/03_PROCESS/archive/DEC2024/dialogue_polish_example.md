# Dialogue Polish Example: Maya Chen

Applying "Consequential Brevity" (Seedship) and "Layered Subtext" (Narrative Supplement).

## 1. Introduction Node (`maya_introduction`)

### **Original (Current Code)**
> "Wait, don't touch that—! Oh. Hi. Sorry. I thought you were... never mind.
>
> Sterne Library. Third floor. The AC is broken and I've been awake for... what day is it?
>
> Biochem notes. Robotics parts. It's a disaster. I'm a disaster."
>
> *Micro-Action: [She pushes a stray lock of hair behind her ear, her hands trembling slightly]*

**Critique:**
- Over-explains the setting ("Sterne Library. Third floor").
- "I'm a disaster" is too on-the-nose (Tell, not Show).
- Explicit micro-action is novelistic, not game-like.

---

### **Polished (Proposed)**
> "Wait—careful with that servo!"
>
> "Oh. subtle. You aren't one of the librarians."
>
> *She exhales, guarding a pile of scatter-shot schematics and biochem textbooks.*
>
> "Sorry. Usually the only people up here are chasing me out."

** improvements:**
- **Action-First:** Starts with immediate conflict ("Careful!").
- **Subtext:** "You aren't one of the librarians" implies she's usually in trouble/hiding, without saying "I am prone to getting kicked out."
- **Visuals:** Replaces explicit stage direction with a merged narrative line ("guarding a pile...").

## 2. The Reveal (`maya_robotics_passion`)

### **Original**
> "I build these. Or try to. This is a prototype for pediatric grip assistance - helps kids with weak hands grip stuff.
>
> Look. The index actuator's oscillating. I've checked the code like a thousand times. Won't stabilize.
>
> The hand keeps spasming. Fingers clench into a fist.
>
> It's fighting itself. Just like me."

**Critique:**
- "Just like me" is the definition of "on-the-nose". Subtext should be implied.
- Technical explanation is dry.

---

### **Polished**
> "Pediatric grip assist. Prototype 4."
>
> *She gestures to the mechanical hand. It spasms, fingers clenching into a rigid fist.*
>
> "Code is clean. Power is stable. But every time I initialize the grip..."
>
> "It fights itself. It knows what it needs to do, but it just... locks up."

**Improvements:**
- **Show, Don't Tell:** "It fights itself" is left hanging. The player *knows* she's talking about herself. We don't say "Just like me."
- **Pacing:** Short, rhythmic sentences.
