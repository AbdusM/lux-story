## GAMEPLAY PATH SUGGESTIONS

To encounter the most visual variety:

2. **Talk to Samuel** extensively (3-4 exchanges)
3. **Open Journal** and capture all three tabs
4. **Open The Prism** for constellation views
5. **Return to Samuel** and ask about other characters
6. **Travel to another character** if the option appears
7. **Look for simulation triggers** in dialogue choices

---

## PRIORITY SCREENSHOTS (If Time Limited)

If you can only capture 5 screenshots, prioritize:

1. **Title screen** (Slide 1)
2. **Full gameplay interface** with dialogue + choices (Slide 4)
3. **Network/Constellation view** (Slide 12)
4. **Skills tab** (Slide 17)
5. **Simulation interface** if available (Slide 28)

## NOTES FOR VISUAL DESIGN

The pitch deck has a dark gradient aesthetic. The app's existing dark theme should match well. Key visual elements to highlight:

- **Glass-morphic panels** with subtle blur
- **Pixel art character avatars** (32x32, Zootopia-style animals)
- **Constellation node graphs** with glowing connections
- **Choice buttons** with pattern indicators
- **Marquee shimmer effects** on navigation (subtle attention direction)

These visuals differentiate us from generic chatbot interfaces.
