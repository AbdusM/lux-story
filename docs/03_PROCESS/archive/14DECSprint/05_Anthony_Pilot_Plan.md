# Urban Chamber Pilot Plan - Anthony Partnership

**Date:** December 14, 2024
**Pilot Launch:** February 2025
**Partner:** Anthony Hood, Birmingham Urban Chamber
**Cohort Size:** 16 graduating high school students
**Pilot Fee:** $5,000-$10,000
**Duration:** 2-3 weeks

---

## Executive Summary

The Urban Chamber pilot is Lux Story's first B2B validation test. If 16 Birmingham students complete character arcs and discover career insights, we have evidence that the game doubles as career exploration. If not, we pivot to pure game launch.

**Success Criteria:**
- 70%+ completion rate (11+ students complete at least 1 character arc)
- 60%+ say "this helped me explore career paths"
- Career cluster correlations emerge (patterns → careers)

**Strategic Value:**
- $5-10K revenue (funds Month 2-3 development)
- Real-world validation of career hypothesis
- Case study for future B2B sales
- Testimonials for marketing

## Pre-Pilot: Securing Anthony's Commitment

### Email Template (Send: December 16-20, 2024)

**Subject:** Lux Story Pilot - Birmingham Urban Chamber Partnership

---

Hey Anthony,

Quick follow-up from our conversation about career exploration tools.

**Lux Story is ready for pilot testing in February 2025.**

I've built a narrative game where Birmingham students explore career paths through conversations with professionals. It's like Pokemon meets career counseling—character-driven, mobile-first, 15-minute sessions.

**The ask:** I'd like to run a pilot with your 16 graduating high school students in February.

**What you get:**
- Free access for all 16 students (2-3 weeks)
- Admin dashboard showing engagement, pattern distribution, career clusters
- Pilot results report (completion rates, career insights, student feedback)
- First look at what works for workforce development

**What I need:**
- $5,000-$10,000 pilot fee (covers my time + validates market demand)
- Student email addresses (for access links)
- Your feedback on what makes this useful for educators

**Timeline:**
- January: Finalize pilot structure, prep platform
- February 1-3: Launch (students start playing)
- February 14-21: Mid-pilot check-in
- February 28: Wrap-up, exit interviews
- March 7: Deliver pilot results report

**Why February?**
- Students are thinking about next steps (college, career, gap year)
- Natural timing for career exploration
- Low-pressure environment (after college apps, before graduation stress)

Interested? I can send a more detailed pilot proposal, or we can hop on a call this week.

Best,
[Your Name]

### Follow-Up (If No Response in 5 Days)

**Subject:** Re: Lux Story Pilot

---

Anthony,

Wanted to make sure this didn't get buried.

I know you're juggling a lot with Urban Chamber programming. Here's the TL;DR:

**Pilot**: 16 students play Lux Story for 2-3 weeks in February
**Cost**: $5,000-$10,000
**Deliverable**: Data on what career paths your students are drawn to

If this isn't the right timing, no worries. I can also run a pilot with a smaller group (5-8 students) for $2,500 if that's easier to budget.

Let me know.

Best,
[Your Name]

---

### Pricing Negotiation Framework

**Proposed Tiers:**
- **Pilot Tier** ($5,000): 16 students, 3 weeks, basic admin dashboard, results report
- **Standard Tier** ($10,000): 16 students, 3 weeks, enhanced dashboard, exit interviews, facilitation guide
- **Bare Bones** ($2,500): 8 students, 2 weeks, no dashboard (manual data export)

**What to Emphasize:**
- This is validation-priced (normally $15-20K for 16 students)
- Revenue share: If pilot succeeds, Birmingham Urban Chamber gets 10% discount on future cohorts
- Early partner advantage: Anthony's feedback shapes the product

**If Anthony Says "Can we do it for free?":**
> "I totally get budget constraints. Here's an alternative: I can do this pilot at cost ($2,500) if Urban Chamber can help me recruit 2-3 other workforce orgs for Q2 pilots. That way we both win—you get the tool, I get validation across multiple cohorts."

**Day 2-3: Monitor Start Rate**

Target: 80%+ (13+ students) start playing within 48 hours

**If <80% by Day 3:**
- Send reminder email: "Haven't started yet? Here's what you're missing..."
- Reach out to Anthony: "Can you encourage students to try it this weekend?"

---

### Phase 2: Active Pilot (February 4-21, 2025)

- Session duration: Are they spending 10-15 min per session?
- Node progression: Are they reaching node 10+ (first session boundary)?
- Drop-off points: Where are students stopping?

**Red Flags (Fix Within 24 Hours):**
- <50% start rate by Day 3 → Send reminder + offer Zoom walkthrough
- Avg session <3 minutes → Something's broken or confusing
- Same node repeated 5+ times → Infinite loop bug

**Green Flags (Celebrate):**
- 80%+ start rate → Email Anthony: "Great engagement! Students are loving it."
- Avg session 10+ minutes → Students are engaged

### Phase 3: Data Analysis (February 22-28, 2025)

#### Quantitative Metrics

**Engagement:**
```sql
-- PostHog query
SELECT
  COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) as total_students,
  COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN session_count > 0 THEN user_id END) as started,
  COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN max_node >= 35 THEN user_id END) as completed_arc,
  AVG(session_duration_minutes) as avg_session,
  AVG(session_count) as avg_sessions
FROM pilot_cohort_urban_chamber_feb_2025
```

**Expected Results:**
| Metric | Target | Good | Red Flag |
|--------|--------|------|----------|
| Start Rate | 80% | 13+ students | <10 students |
| Completion Rate | 70% | 11+ students | <8 students |
| Avg Session | 12 min | 10-15 min | <5 min |
| Avg Sessions | 3-4 | 2+ | 1 |

**Pattern Distribution:**
```sql
SELECT
  pattern_type,
  AVG(pattern_level) as avg_level,
  MIN(pattern_level) as min_level,
  MAX(pattern_level) as max_level
FROM pattern_data
WHERE cohort_id = 'urban_chamber_feb_2025'
GROUP BY pattern_type
```

**Career Cluster Analysis:**
```typescript
// lib/career-analysis.ts
export function analyzeCareerClusters(students: StudentData[]): CareerClusterReport {
  const clusters = students.map(student => {
    const topPatterns = getTopPatterns(student.patterns, 2)
    return mapPatternsToCareer(topPatterns)
  })

  // Group students by career cluster
  const grouped = groupBy(clusters, 'cluster')

  return {
    clusters: Object.keys(grouped).map(cluster => ({
      name: cluster,
      studentCount: grouped[cluster].length,
      percentage: grouped[cluster].length / students.length,
      topPatterns: mostCommonPatterns(grouped[cluster])
    }))
  }
}
```

**Example Output:**
| Career Cluster | Student Count | % of Cohort | Dominant Patterns |
|----------------|---------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Healthcare | 6 | 37.5% | Helping + Patience |
| Engineering/Tech | 4 | 25% | Analytical + Building |
| Creative/Design | 3 | 18.75% | Exploring + Building |
| Education/Service | 2 | 12.5% | Helping + Exploring |
| Business/Leadership | 1 | 6.25% | Building + Analytical |

### Phase 4: Decision Framework (March 1-7, 2025)

#### Scenario A: Strong Career Validation (70%+ Say "Yes")

**Quantitative Evidence:**
- 70%+ completion rate (11+ students finished at least 1 arc)
- Mid-pilot survey: 60%+ said "Yes, definitely" to career exploration
- Exit interviews: 70%+ said "This helped me explore careers"
- Career clusters correlate with patterns (clear signal)

**Decision:** **Dual Positioning** (Game + Career Tool)

**Next Steps:**
1. Build B2B package (admin dashboard, educator guide)
2. Create case study: "Birmingham Urban Chamber Pilot Results"
3. Reach out to 10 other Urban Chamber chapters (Atlanta, Nashville, Memphis)
4. Reach out to workforce orgs (YearUp, Per Scholas, NPower)
5. Pursue 2-3 more pilots in Q2 ($5-10K each)

**Messaging:**
- B2B: "70% of Birmingham students completed character arcs and discovered career paths"
- Game: "A narrative game that doubles as career exploration"

---

#### Scenario B: Moderate Validation (40-69% Say "Yes")

**Quantitative Evidence:**
- 50-70% completion rate
- Mid-pilot survey: 40-60% said "Somewhat" or "Yes"
- Exit interviews: Mixed feedback—some loved it, some didn't see career value
- Career clusters present but not strong signal

**Decision:** **Game-First, Career-Secondary**

**Next Steps:**
1. Keep career framing (Journey Summary shows career clusters)
2. Don't over-invest in B2B infrastructure
3. Focus on indie game launch (Steam, itch.io)
4. Test podcast sponsorships (career development platforms)
5. One more small pilot in Q2 to gather more data

**Messaging:**
- Game: "A narrative RPG about identity and becoming"
- Career framing: "Players discover professional patterns through character arcs"

---

#### Scenario C: Career Hypothesis Failed (<40% Say "Yes")

**Quantitative Evidence:**
- <50% completion rate
- Mid-pilot survey: <40% said career exploration helped
- Exit interviews: "Fun game, but didn't help me think about careers"
- Career clusters weak or random

**Decision:** **Pure Game**

**Next Steps:**
1. Drop career framing entirely
2. Remove "career exploration" from marketing
3. Full indie game launch (itch.io, Steam)
4. Focus on narrative quality, replayability, New Game+
5. Build for gamers who love character-driven stories

**Messaging:**
- "A narrative RPG about identity, choice, and becoming"
- "Disco Elysium meets Pokemon in a magical train station"

---

## Failure Scenarios & Pivots

### Scenario 1: Low Start Rate (<50%)

**Symptoms:**
- Only 8 students started playing by Day 3
- Students say "I forgot" or "I didn't have time"

**Diagnosis:**
- Not enough motivation to engage
- Access link buried in email
- Competing priorities (school, work, etc.)

**Pivot:**
- Offer incentive: "$25 gift card for completing 1 arc" (for all, not just interviews)
- Ask Anthony to promote in person (not just email)
- Extend pilot by 1 week

---

### Scenario 2: High Drop-Off After Node 5

**Symptoms:**
- Students start playing but stop after 5-10 nodes
- Avg session <5 minutes

**Diagnosis:**
- Not engaging enough
- Friction in UX (mobile issues, slow loading, confusing choices)
- Characters don't resonate

**Pivot:**
- Emergency UX audit (within 24 hours)
- Fix critical bugs
- Simplify onboarding
- Add "quick start" option (skip Samuel intro, go straight to character)

---

### Scenario 3: Students Love It, But No Career Insight

**Symptoms:**
- 70%+ completion rate
- Students say "fun game" but not "helped with career exploration"
- Exit interviews: "I liked the characters but didn't think about careers"

**Diagnosis:**
- Game mechanics work, career framing doesn't
- Need stronger connection between patterns and careers
- Journey Summary not clear enough

**Pivot:**
- Enhance Journey Summary (add explicit career recommendations)
- Create "Career Pathways" guide (separate document linking patterns → careers)
- Run one more pilot with enhanced career framing (Q2)

---

## Post-Pilot: Next Steps (March 8+)

### If B2B Validated (70%+)

**Immediate (March 8-14):**
- Email Anthony: "Pilot was a success! 73% completion, students loved it."
- Ask for testimonial: "Can you write a paragraph about how this helped your students?"
- Request referrals: "Which other Urban Chamber chapters should I reach out to?"

**Week 2 (March 15-21):**
- Create case study PDF: "Birmingham Urban Chamber Pilot Results"
- Update website: Add "B2B Workforce Development" page
- Reach out to 10 Urban Chamber chapters (Atlanta, Charlotte, Nashville, Memphis, New Orleans, etc.)

**Week 3-4 (March 22 - April 4):**
- Build B2B admin dashboard
- Write educator guide
- Package pricing ($5-10K per cohort)
- Sales outreach (YearUp, Per Scholas, NPower)

**Goal:** 2-3 B2B pilots secured for Q2 ($10-30K revenue)

---

### If Pure Game (< 40%)

**Immediate (March 8-14):**
- Email Anthony: "Thanks for the pilot. Students enjoyed it as a game, but career framing didn't resonate as strongly as hoped."
- Pivot messaging: Lux Story is a narrative game (drop "career exploration")
- Focus on indie game launch

**Week 2 (March 15-21):**
- Polish Journey Summary 2.0 (shareable cards, pattern archetypes)
- Create itch.io page (free to play)
- Steam page setup (launch Q2, $9.99)

**Week 3-4 (March 22 - April 4):**
- Indie game marketing (Twitter/X, Reddit, TikTok)
- Reach out to narrative game streamers
- Build community (Discord)

**Goal:** 1,000 itch.io downloads by end of Q2

### Reminder Email (If Student Hasn't Started)

**Subject:** Haven't Checked Out Lux Story Yet?

---

Hey [Student Name],

I noticed you haven't logged into Lux Story yet. No worries—life gets busy!

Just wanted to make sure you didn't miss the email with your access link:

[Access link]

**What you're missing:**
- 11 characters to meet (surgeon, engineer, organizer, philosopher, etc.)
- 15-minute sessions (mobile-friendly, play anywhere)
- Career insights based on your choices

**Challenge:** Try just ONE character conversation this weekend. If you don't like it after 10 minutes, totally fine.

But I think you'll be surprised.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Best,
[Your Name]

### Thank You Email (After Pilot Ends)

**Subject:** Thank You for Being Part of Lux Story's First Cohort

---

Hey [Student Name],

The pilot is officially over. Thank you for being part of Lux Story's first cohort.

**What happens next:**
- I'm analyzing all the data and feedback
- March 7: I'll share a pilot results report with Urban Chamber
- April: Station 2 (Innovation Hub) launches—you'll get early access

**You helped shape this.** Your feedback, your choices, your patterns—all of it helps me build something better.

If you want to keep playing, your account stays active. New characters coming soon.

Best,
[Your Name]

## Key Takeaways

1. **Anthony's partnership is validation, not just revenue.**
   - $5-10K pilot fee is nice
   - Real value: Evidence that career framing works (or doesn't)

2. **70% completion is the threshold.**
   - If 11+ students finish, we have engagement
   - If not, we have a UX problem or motivation problem

3. **Exit interviews are gold.**
   - 8 students × 30 min = 4 hours
   - But those 4 hours tell us if we have a B2B product or not

4. **Fail fast, pivot faster.**
   - If Week 1 shows red flags, fix immediately
   - Don't wait until Week 3 to address issues

5. **The decision is binary: B2B or Game.**
   - 70%+ → Dual positioning (both)
   - <40% → Pure game
   - 40-69% → One more pilot to confirm

---

*"This pilot isn't about perfection. It's about evidence. Let the data decide."*
