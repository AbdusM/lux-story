## Strategic Direction: Why Content Beast?

You chose **Path A: Content Beast** over platform play or pure B2B because:

1. **Plays to strengths:** Character writing, systems design, narrative craft
2. **Respects investment:** 16,763 lines of dialogue, 11 characters already built
3. **Scalable with AI:** AI-assisted content pipeline reduces creation time 64%
4. **Multiple revenue streams:** Game sales + B2B pilots + podcast + future stations
5. **Validation-driven:** Urban Chamber pilot proves/disproves career hypothesis
6. **No compromise:** Build exceptional game, career value emerges organically

**Core belief:** Disco Elysium didn't set out to be a political philosophy tool. It became one because it was exceptional. Lux Story doesn't need to choose—if it's genuinely exceptional, it becomes both.

## This Week's Priorities

1. **Code:** Implement session boundaries system (Week 3)
2. **Business:** Email Anthony about February pilot
3. **Content:** Start recording professional interviews (5-10 by end of January)

*"We're not choosing between game and career tool. We're building something exceptional and letting the market tell us what it is."*
