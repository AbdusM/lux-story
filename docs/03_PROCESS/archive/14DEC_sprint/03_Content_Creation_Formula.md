# Content Creation Formula - 10-Node Character Arc Template

**Date:** December 14, 2024
**Strategic Direction:** Path A - Content Beast Mode
**Goal:** Scale from 11 characters (270 nodes) to 55 characters (450+ nodes) across 5 stations

---

## The Core Formula

**10-Node Character Arc = 35 minutes of gameplay**

Each character tells a complete story in ~35 nodes:
- **Act 1: Introduction** (Nodes 1-10) - Low trust, surface interactions
- **Act 2: Crossroads** (Nodes 11-20) - Medium trust, revealing decision point
- **Act 3: Challenge** (Nodes 21-30) - High trust, vulnerability
- **Act 4: Insight** (Nodes 31-35+) - Resolution, pattern crystallization

**Why 10 nodes per act?**
- Pacing: ~3-4 min per act (mobile-friendly)
- Pattern balance: 2 opportunities per pattern per act
- Trust progression: Natural relationship deepening
- Session boundaries: Acts align with natural pause points

---

## Act Structure Breakdown

### Act 1: Introduction (Nodes 1-10)

**Purpose:** Hook player, establish character voice, build initial trust

**Narrative Beats:**
1. **Hook** (Node 1): Immediate intrigue or relatable problem
2. **Context** (Nodes 2-3): Who they are, what they do, where they are
3. **Surface Conflict** (Nodes 4-6): Low-stakes problem that reveals personality
4. **Pattern Introduction** (Nodes 7-9): First glimpse of deeper themes
5. **Bridge to Act 2** (Node 10): Question or decision that leads to crossroads

**Trust Level:** 0 → 3
- Early nodes: Safe questions, no vulnerability required
- Later nodes: Player earns trust through choices
- Trust gate at Node 10: Need trust ≥2 to continue

**Pattern Distribution:**
- Analytical: 2 choices
- Helping: 2 choices
- Exploring: 2 choices
- Building: 2 choices
- Patience: 2 choices
- Total: 10 pattern opportunities (avg 1 per node)

**Example: Maya's Introduction**
```typescript
// Node 1: Hook
"You look lost. First time at Grand Central Terminus?"
[Player notices the medical textbook in her bag → Observant/Analytical]

// Node 2-3: Context
"I'm Maya. Pre-med. Or... I'm supposed to be."
[Player asks why "supposed to be" → Exploring]
[Player offers support → Helping]

// Node 4-6: Surface Conflict
"My anatomy exam is in two days. I keep mixing up the brachial plexus."
[Player suggests study techniques → Building]
[Player listens without advice → Patience]

// Node 7-9: Pattern Introduction
"My parents sacrificed everything for me to be here. I can't fail them."
[Player asks about her own desires → Exploring]
[Player validates the pressure she feels → Helping]

// Node 10: Bridge
"Do you think it's possible to want something and dread it at the same time?"
[Trust gate: If trust ≥2, continue to Act 2]
```

---

### Act 2: Crossroads (Nodes 11-20)

**Purpose:** Present a meaningful decision point from the character's career journey

**Narrative Beats:**
1. **The Crossroads** (Nodes 11-13): Character reveals a past or current decision point
2. **Stakes** (Nodes 14-16): What's at risk, why it matters
3. **Perspectives** (Nodes 17-18): Different ways to view the choice
4. **Player Reflection** (Nodes 19-20): Player makes a choice or offers perspective

**Trust Level:** 3 → 6
- Character shares vulnerability
- Player's choices have visible impact on character's self-perception
- Trust gate at Node 20: Need trust ≥5 to continue

**Pattern Focus:**
- Emphasize 2-3 dominant patterns for this character
- Example: Maya = Helping (60%) + Analytical (30%) + Patience (10%)

**Example: Maya's Crossroads**
```typescript
// Node 11-13: The Crossroads
"I got accepted to Johns Hopkins and UAB. Hopkins is the dream. But UAB is where my family is."
[Player asks what she wants → Exploring]
[Player analyzes pros/cons → Analytical]

// Node 14-16: Stakes
"If I go to Hopkins, my little brother loses his role model. If I stay, I might resent them forever."
[Player validates both sides → Helping]
[Player suggests she take time to decide → Patience]

// Node 17-18: Perspectives
"My advisor said 'opportunities like Hopkins don't come twice.' But my mom said 'family is everything.'"
[Player questions whose dream this is → Exploring]
[Player reframes: 'What would you tell your brother to do?' → Helping]

// Node 19-20: Player Reflection
"What would you do?"
[Player: 'Follow the opportunity' → Analytical]
[Player: 'Stay close to family' → Helping]
[Player: 'There's no wrong answer' → Patience]

[Trust increases based on alignment with Maya's values]
```

---

### Act 3: Challenge (Nodes 21-30)

**Purpose:** Show the character facing their biggest obstacle, reveal deeper patterns

**Narrative Beats:**
1. **The Challenge** (Nodes 21-23): Character faces a difficult situation
2. **Struggle** (Nodes 24-26): Character tries and fails (or struggles)
3. **Vulnerability** (Nodes 27-28): Character admits fear, doubt, or insecurity
4. **Support or Insight** (Nodes 29-30): Player helps character see a new perspective

**Trust Level:** 6 → 9
- Deepest vulnerability
- Character may cry, admit failure, or reveal trauma
- Player's role shifts from observer to confidant

**Pattern Revelation:**
- Character's dominant pattern becomes clear
- Example: Maya's "Helping" pattern is both strength and burden

**Example: Maya's Challenge**
```typescript
// Node 21-23: The Challenge
"I failed my anatomy practical. First time I've ever failed anything."
[Player asks how she's feeling → Helping]
[Player asks what went wrong → Analytical]

// Node 24-26: Struggle
"I studied 60 hours this week. I know the material. But when I stood at that cadaver, I froze."
[Player explores what triggered the freeze → Exploring]
[Player validates that failure is part of learning → Patience]

// Node 27-28: Vulnerability
"What if I'm not cut out for this? What if I'm only doing this because it's what everyone expects?"
[Player asks what SHE wants, separate from others → Exploring]
[Player shares a time they questioned their path → Helping]

// Node 29-30: Support or Insight
"You're right. I've been so focused on not failing my family, I forgot to ask if this is my dream."
[Player encourages her to explore that question → Exploring]
[Player affirms that medicine can still be HER choice → Helping]

[Trust reaches 9 - confidant status]
```

---

### Act 4: Insight (Nodes 31-35+)

**Purpose:** Resolution, character growth, pattern crystallization

**Narrative Beats:**
1. **Realization** (Nodes 31-32): Character synthesizes their journey
2. **Decision** (Nodes 33-34): Character makes a choice or commitment
3. **Future Path** (Node 35+): Character looks forward, player sees impact

**Trust Level:** 9 → 10
- Character thanks player for their support
- Relationship status: Confidant
- Potential for ongoing relationship in future acts

**Pattern Internalization:**
- Character's arc should mirror player's pattern growth
- If player internalized "Helping" pattern, Maya notices and acknowledges it

**Example: Maya's Insight**
```typescript
// Node 31-32: Realization
"I talked to my anatomy professor. I'm retaking the practical. But more than that... I asked myself why I froze."
[Player asks what she discovered → Exploring]

// Node 33-34: Decision
"I DO want to be a doctor. Not because of my parents. Because when I see someone in pain, I can't not help. That's who I am."
[Player affirms her choice → Helping]
[Player asks about her path forward → Building]

// Node 35+: Future Path
"I'm staying at UAB. Not because I'm scared of Hopkins. Because I want to serve my community. That's MY dream."
[Player celebrates her decision → Helping]
[Player asks about her brother → Exploring]

// Meta-Reflection (if player has Helping identity internalized)
"You know... you remind me of why I'm doing this. You helped me see clearly. Thank you."
[Trust reaches 10 - full confidant]
```

}

## Requirements

1. CHARACTER VOICE
   - Use the professional's actual phrases and speech patterns
   - If they said "you know" a lot, include that
   - Match their energy (formal vs casual, enthusiastic vs measured)

2. PATTERN BALANCE
   - Each act should offer ALL 5 patterns at least twice
   - Dominant patterns appear 60% of the time across the arc
   - No pattern should be <10% representation

3. TRUST PROGRESSION
   - Act 1: Trust 0 → 3 (surface questions, no vulnerability)
   - Act 2: Trust 3 → 6 (reveal crossroads, but not trauma)
   - Act 3: Trust 6 → 9 (deep vulnerability, fear, failure)
   - Act 4: Trust 9 → 10 (resolution, gratitude)

4. SHOW, DON'T TELL
   - Don't say "I'm a detail-oriented person"
   - DO say "I count the rivets on the surgical table before I start"
   - Reveal career through specific stories, not abstractions

5. CROSSROADS MOMENT (Nodes 11-14)
   - Must be a REAL decision the professional faced
   - Stakes should be clear (what's at risk)
   - **4 CHOICES** (Analytical, Helping, Exploring, Building/Patience)
   - No obvious "right answer" - both paths valid

6. PRESSURE TEST (Nodes 15-18) **[NEW REQUIREMENT]**
   - Time-compressed urgent decisions (minutes, not days)
   - Multiple simultaneous demands (3+ crises)
   - Limited resources (can't handle everything)
   - Example: "3 patients need attention, 1 hour, can see one. Which?"
   - Reveals HOW player prioritizes under pressure
   - Pattern revealed by WHAT they choose, not explicit statements

7. CHALLENGE (Nodes 21-30)
   - **Ethical dilemma** (nodes 21-25): Professional + personal stakes
   - Professional's hardest moment
   - Include failure, doubt, or near-breaking point
   - Don't sugarcoat - show real struggle

8. UNEXPECTED MOMENT (Nodes 32-34) **[NEW REQUIREMENT]**
   - Small gesture reveals why work matters emotionally
   - Often relationship-based (patient, student, colleague, user)
   - NOT preachy or obvious
   - Shows impact character didn't realize they had
   - Example: Patient's daughter thanks doctor for "seeing mom, not just image"

9. SESSION BOUNDARIES
   - Mark nodes 10, 20, 30 as session boundaries
   - Each boundary should have a platform announcement
   - Example: "The 7:15 to Crossroads Station will depart shortly..."

8. DIALOGUE CHUNKS
   - Break long speeches into 2-4 chunks
   - Each chunk: 1-3 sentences max
   - Use pauses for dramatic effect: { pause: 1500 }

## Example Good vs Bad

BAD (Too Abstract):
"I'm passionate about helping people and medicine has always interested me."

GOOD (Specific Story):
"I was twelve when my grandmother had a stroke. I watched the ER doctor explain everything to my mom in a way that made her stop crying. I thought: I want to be that person."

BAD (Obvious Choice):
Choice A: "Work hard and succeed" (good)
Choice B: "Give up and fail" (bad)

GOOD (Real Dilemma):
Choice A: "Follow prestige (Johns Hopkins)" (pattern: analytical)
Choice B: "Stay near family (UAB)" (pattern: helping)
Both valid. No "right" answer.

## Output Format

Return ONLY valid JSON. No markdown, no explanations.

### Stage 3: Human Review (90 minutes)

**Checklist:**

**1. Character Voice Consistency**
- [ ] Does this sound like the professional?
- [ ] Are phrases authentic to the interview?
- [ ] Is tone consistent (formal, casual, energetic, measured)?
- [ ] Does dialogue feel natural when read aloud?

**2. Pattern Balance**
- [ ] All 5 patterns represented in each act?
- [ ] Dominant patterns align with professional's actual behavior?
- [ ] No pattern >70% or <10% across full arc?
- [ ] Pattern choices feel organic, not forced?

**3. Trust Progression**
- [ ] Act 1 feels low-stakes, inviting?
- [ ] Act 2 reveals vulnerability without trauma-dumping?
- [ ] Act 3 shows real struggle and failure?
- [ ] Act 4 resolves without feeling preachy?
- [ ] Trust gates make sense (2, 5, 8)?

**4. Crossroads Quality (Nodes 11-14)**
- [ ] Is this a real decision the professional faced?
- [ ] Are stakes clear and meaningful?
- [ ] **4 choices** (Analytical, Helping, Exploring, Building/Patience)?
- [ ] Both/all choices feel valid?
- [ ] No obvious "right answer"?
- [ ] Player perspective matters?

**5. Pressure Test (Nodes 15-18)** **[NEW]**
- [ ] Time-compressed scenario (minutes/hours, not days)?
- [ ] Multiple simultaneous demands (3+ crises)?
- [ ] Limited resources (can't do everything)?
- [ ] Each choice sacrifices something?
- [ ] Pattern revealed by prioritization, not exposition?

**6. Challenge Depth (Nodes 21-30)**
- [ ] **Ethical dilemma** present (nodes 21-25)?
- [ ] Professional + personal stakes?
- [ ] Does character face real failure or struggle?
- [ ] Is vulnerability earned (not random trauma)?
- [ ] Does player's support feel meaningful?

- [ ] Shows impact character didn't realize?
- [ ] NOT preachy or obvious?
- [ ] Connects work to emotional meaning?

**8. Session Boundaries**
- [ ] Natural pause points at nodes 10, 20, 30?
- [ ] Platform announcements fit station atmosphere?
- [ ] Player has reason to take a break (reflection prompt)?

**7. Dialogue Chunking**
- [ ] No paragraphs >3 sentences?
- [ ] Pauses used for dramatic effect?
- [ ] Pacing feels natural (not rushed or dragging)?

**Common Fixes:**
- **Too abstract**: Add specific stories, replace generalizations
- **Obvious choices**: Reframe as dilemmas with trade-offs
- **Forced patterns**: Let character voice drive, patterns emerge naturally
- **Rushed trust**: Add intermediary nodes to earn vulnerability
- **Preachy resolution**: Show growth through action, not monologue

---

### Stage 4: TypeScript Generation (2 minutes)

**Automated Script:**

```typescript
// lib/ai-pipeline/generate-typescript.ts
export function generateDialogueGraph(arc: CharacterArcData): string {
  const imports = `
import { DialogueNode } from '@/lib/dialogue-graph'
import { DialogueNodeWithMultipleContent } from '@/lib/dialogue-types'

export const ${arc.characterId}DialogueGraph: DialogueNode[] = [
${arc.acts.flatMap(act => act.nodes).map(node => generateNodeCode(node)).join(',\n')}
]

export const ${arc.characterId}EntryPoints = {
  INTRODUCTION: '${arc.characterId}_intro_1',
  CROSSROADS: '${arc.characterId}_crossroads_1',
  CHALLENGE: '${arc.characterId}_challenge_1',
  INSIGHT: '${arc.characterId}_insight_1'
} as const
`

  return imports
}

function generateNodeCode(node: DialogueNodeData): string {
  return `  {
    nodeId: '${node.nodeId}',
    speaker: '${node.speaker}',
    content: [
${node.content.map(chunk => `      { text: "${escapeQuotes(chunk.text)}", emotion: "${chunk.emotion}" }`).join(',\n')}
    ],
    choices: [
${node.choices.map(choice => generateChoiceCode(choice)).join(',\n')}
    ]${node.sessionBoundary ? `,
    metadata: {
      sessionBoundary: true,
      platformAnnouncement: "${node.platformAnnouncement}"
    }` : ''}
  }`
}
```

**Output:** Valid TypeScript file ready for integration

---

### Stage 5: Integration Testing (30 minutes)

**Manual Testing Flow:**

1. **Import character graph**
```typescript
// content/[character-id]-dialogue-graph.ts
import { generateDialogueGraph } from '@/lib/ai-pipeline/generate-typescript'
// Paste generated code
```

2. **Add to character registry**
```typescript
// lib/characters.ts
export const characters = [
  // ... existing characters
  {
    id: 'maya_chen',
    name: 'Maya Chen',
    role: 'Pre-med Student',
    avatar: 'cat',
    entryPoint: 'maya_intro_1'
  }
]
```

3. **Test dialogue flow**
- [ ] Start character arc from introduction
- [ ] Make 5 different pattern choices
- [ ] Verify trust increases correctly
- [ ] Reach first session boundary (node 10)
- [ ] Continue to crossroads (node 11-20)
- [ ] Verify all choices are reachable
- [ ] Check for dead ends or infinite loops

4. **Pattern distribution analysis**
```typescript
// Test script
const choices = getAllChoicesInArc('maya_chen')
const patternCounts = choices.reduce((acc, choice) => {
  if (choice.pattern) acc[choice.pattern]++
  return acc
}, { analytical: 0, helping: 0, building: 0, patience: 0, exploring: 0 })

console.log('Pattern distribution:', patternCounts)
// Should match dominantPatterns from arc extraction
```

5. **Voice consistency check**
- Read dialogue aloud
- Does it sound like the professional?
- Are transitions smooth?
- Any awkward phrasing?

**Go/No-Go Decision:**
- ✅ All choices reachable
- ✅ No TypeScript errors
- ✅ Trust progression works
- ✅ Pattern balance within ±10%
- ✅ Voice feels authentic
- ✅ Session boundaries natural

→ **Ship to production**

## Quality Benchmarks

### What Makes a Great Character Arc?

**1. Memorable Hook**
- First node makes player curious
- Example: Maya's "supposed to be" pre-med
- Avoid: Generic introductions ("Hi, I'm X and I do Y")

**2. Authentic Voice**
- Dialogue feels like real person, not ChatGPT
- Character has verbal tics, phrases, rhythm
- Example: Samuel's "you notice that?"

**3. Real Dilemma**
- Crossroads presents genuine trade-off
- No "Disney villain" obvious bad choices
- Player's perspective matters

**4. Earned Vulnerability**
- Challenge reveals struggle AFTER trust is built
- Failure feels real, not performative
- Example: Maya's anatomy exam failure

**5. Pattern Revelation**
- Character's journey mirrors a pattern
- Player sees how pattern plays out in career
- Example: Maya's "helping" is both gift and burden

**6. Satisfying Resolution**
- Insight feels earned through the journey
- Character makes decision based on self-knowledge
- Player feels their support mattered

**7. Replayability**
- Different pattern choices lead to different conversations
- High-trust vs low-trust branches
- Easter eggs for players who return

---

## Pattern-to-Career Mapping

### Career Clusters by Dominant Pattern

**Helping + Patience:**
- Healthcare (nursing, therapy, social work)
- Education (teaching, counseling)
- Nonprofit (community organizing)

**Analytical + Building:**
- Engineering (software, mechanical, biomedical)
- Research (scientific, academic)
- Data science

**Exploring + Analytical:**
- Investigative journalism
- UX research
- Product management

**Building + Helping:**
- Design (product, UX, service)
- Entrepreneurship (social impact)
- Public health

**Patience + Exploring:**
- Trades (electrician, plumber, carpenter)
- Conservation (environmental science)
- Archival work

**Character Arc Formula:**
- Identify professional's 2 dominant patterns from interview
- Structure crossroads around pattern tension
- Example: Maya's helping (family pressure) vs analytical (prestige)

---

## Session Boundary Placement

### Every 10 Nodes = Natural Pause Point

**Platform Announcement Examples:**

**Node 10 (End of Act 1):**
> "The 7:15 to Crossroads Station will depart shortly. Please ensure all belongings are secure."

**Node 20 (End of Act 2):**
> "Attention travelers: The Northbound Express to Challenge Terminal is now boarding on Platform 3."

**Node 30 (End of Act 3):**
> "Final call for the 9:45 to Insight Avenue. All passengers, please board now."

**Why This Works:**
- Mobile sessions naturally 10-15 min (approx. 10 nodes)
- Acts align with pause points
- Platform announcements reinforce station atmosphere
- Auto-save triggers (player can close app safely)

---

## Intersection Scenes (Advanced)

### What Are Intersections?

**Definition:** Scenes where two characters appear together, creating career crossover insights.

**Example: Maya + Devon (Medicine + Robotics)**
```typescript
// Triggered when player has trust ≥5 with BOTH Maya and Devon
{
  nodeId: 'intersection_maya_devon_1',
  speakers: ['Maya Chen', 'Devon Kumar'],
  content: [
    {
      speaker: 'Maya Chen',
      text: "Devon! I didn't know you came to the Terminus."
    },
    {
      speaker: 'Devon Kumar',
      text: "Yeah, I've been working on a surgical robot prototype. Actually... you're pre-med, right? Can I ask your opinion?"
    }
  ],
  choices: [
    {
      text: "I'm curious about the robot",
      pattern: "exploring",
      nextNodeId: "intersection_maya_devon_2_exploring"
    },
    {
      text: "How can I help?",
      pattern: "helping",
      nextNodeId: "intersection_maya_devon_2_helping"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Why Intersections Matter:**
- Show career crossovers (biomedical engineering, health tech)
- Deepen character relationships
- Create "wow" moments (players love seeing characters interact)
- Unlock hybrid career paths

**Intersection Formula:**
- Trigger: Trust ≥5 with both characters

## Examples: Great vs Mediocre Dialogue

### Mediocre (AI First Draft)

```
Maya: "I'm a pre-med student studying to become a doctor. I've always been interested in helping people."

Player Choice:
A) "That's great! Medicine is a noble profession."
B) "What made you interested in medicine?"
```

**Problems:**
- Abstract ("helping people")
- Exposition dump
- Obvious "good" choice (B)
- No character voice

---

### Great (Human-Polished)

```
Maya: "You look lost."

[pause]

"First time at Grand Central Terminus? Yeah, me too. Well, sort of. I keep coming back, but I'm not sure I'm supposed to be here."

Player Choices:
A) "I notice you're carrying a medical textbook." (analytical)
B) "What do you mean, 'not supposed to be'?" (exploring)
C) [Say nothing, wait for her to continue] (patience)
```

**Why This Works:**
- Immediate hook ("not supposed to be")
- Specific detail (medical textbook)
- Character voice (uncertain, self-aware)
- All three choices feel natural
- Patterns emerge organically

## Appendix: Professional Interview Script

### Opening (5 min)

"Hey [Name], thanks for doing this. I'm creating a narrative game about career exploration, and I want to feature real professionals like you.

The goal is to turn your career journey into a character arc that helps young people understand what [your career] is really like.

This isn't a job interview—I want the messy, human parts. The doubts, the failures, the moments you almost gave up. Those are the good parts.

Ready?"

### Questions

**Background:**
1. What do you do now? (Job title is boring—tell me what you actually DO on a Tuesday.)
2. How did you get here? (Not the resume version—the real version.)

**Crossroads:**
3. Tell me about a time you had to choose between two good options. What was at stake?
4. What did you choose? Do you ever wonder about the path you didn't take?

**Challenge:**
5. What was the hardest moment in your career? (When did you almost quit?)
6. How did you get through it? (Who or what helped?)

**Insight:**
7. What do you know now that you wish you knew at 18?
8. What surprised you most about this career?

**Advice:**
9. If someone's considering this path, what should they know that nobody talks about?
10. What's one thing people get wrong about [your career]?

### Closing

"This is gold. Thank you. I'm going to turn this into a character arc. When it's ready, I'll send you a preview. Sound good?"
