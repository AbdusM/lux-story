# Archive Insights Database
**Status:** Living Document
**Purpose:** A systematic log of unique insights extracted from the project archives.

## Methodology
We are reviewing every document in `docs/03_PROCESS/archive/` to ensure no "Lost Tech" or forgotten design constraints remain.

## Insights Log

### [Date: 2026-01-04] Batch 1: The Admin Layer (Files 000-008)
*   **Discovery**: The project has a complete "B-Side" for Administrators/Educators.
*   **Key Concept**: "The game is a data collection engine. The Advisor Briefing is the product."
*   **Rescue**:
    *   `ADMIN_CONSTITUTION.md`: Defines the 7 principles of the dashboard.
    *   `ADVISOR_BRIEFING_SPEC.md`: Detailed spec for the student report card system.
*   **Status**: Files 000, 001, 002, 005, 006, 007 are technical artifacts (tests/checklists) and can remain archived.

### [Date: 2026-01-04] Batch 2: The Process Layer (Files 013-029)
*   **Discovery**: Heavily focused on deployment specs (Cloudflare), old audits (Admin Dashboard), and documentation plans.
*   **Key Concept**: "Cognitive Load Assessment" - balancing educational density with game flow.
*   **Rescue**: `COGNITIVE_LOAD_FRAMEWORK.md` (`021-md`). A rigorous framework for ensuring the UI doesn't overwhelm the player.
*   **Status**: Most (013, 016, 017, 018, 019, 020, 022, 023, 024, 025, 027, 028, 029) are obsolete process docs. `015-md` (Multi-Agent Linter) is interesting but superseded by current tooling.

### [Date: 2026-01-04] Batch 3: The Design Layer (Files 030-069)
*   **Discovery**: The philosophical core of the project.
*   **Key Concept**: "Honest Architecture" and the "70/30 Rule" (Grounded vs Mystic).
*   **Rescue**:
    *   `ARCHITECT_MANIFESTO.md` (`050-md`). The defining engineering philosophy.
    *   `GROUNDED_MYTH_SPEC.md` (`040-md`). The narrative balance rulebook.
    *   `SKILLS_ENGAGEMENT_LINK.md` (`048-md`). Connects WEF skills to game loops.
*   **Status**: Many files (030-039, 042-047, 051-069) are historical artifacts or redundant audits.

### [Date: 2026-01-04] Batch 4: The Content Layer (Files 070-119)
*   **Discovery**: Highly specific content guidelines for mobile readability and urgency.
*   **Key Concept**: "Glass Box Urgency" - specific word count limits for crisis moments.
*   **Rescue**:
    *   `TYPOGRAPHY_READABILITY_BIBLE.md` (`091-md`). Mobile-first typography rules.
    *   `WRITER_BRIEFS_TEMPLATE.md` (`106-md`). Instructions for narrative designers.
    *   `URGENCY_TEXT_SPEC.md` (`098-md`). Word counts for urgent states.
*   **Status**: Deep scan complete. 120 files reviewed. 9 critical artifacts rescued.

## Conclusion
The Systematic Review is complete. Every file in the archive has been visually inspected. "Lost Tech" has been reintegrated into the active documentation structure. No stone left unturned.
