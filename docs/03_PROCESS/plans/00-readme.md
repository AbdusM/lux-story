# Plans Index

Last updated: 2026-02-11

## Purpose

This folder stores implementation plans and execution handoff docs.

## Naming Convention

- Prefer `YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>.md` for new plans.
- Keep legacy dated filenames as-is for historical continuity.

## Current Canonical Plan

- `docs/03_PROCESS/plans/2026-02-11-gameplay-improvement-plan.md`

## Notes

- Plans are directional artifacts; implementation truth lives in code, tests, and active process docs.
- Superseded plans should move to `docs/03_PROCESS/archive/` when replaced.
