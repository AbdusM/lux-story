# Post-Development Features (Isolated)

**Date:** January 6, 2026
**Purpose:** Items deferred until after core development is complete
**Status:** NOT ACTIVE - Reference only

---

## Why These Are Isolated

These features are:
- Customer-facing (pilots, onboarding, support)
- Revenue-focused (monetization, licensing, enterprise)
- Integration-dependent (third-party APIs, external systems)
- Scale-focused (infrastructure for growth)
- Speculative (moonshot/research features)

They require a stable, complete product before implementation.
