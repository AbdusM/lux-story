# LUX Story: ABC + STORY Framework

## The Interlock

**ABC** = Design backwards (what outcome do we want?)
**STORY** = Deliver forwards (how do we move them emotionally to yes?)

The bridge: **Care → Stage + Tension**

We figure out why they care (ABC), then we open by setting the scene (Stage) and introducing the conflict blocking them (Tension). Only then do we introduce Opportunity, Resolution, and ask for the Yes.

## LUX Story: Career Exploration Game

### ABC (Design Phase)

**Act:** Play for 20 minutes. Make 3 choices. See your patterns emerge. Explore one career path.

**Believe:** "This isn't another personality test that boxes me in. It's a game that shows me who I'm becoming through what I choose."

**Care:** Jamal is 17. He's been asked "what do you want to be?" since he was 12. He doesn't know. His guidance counselor gave him a 200-question assessment that said "you're analytical" and showed him a list of engineering jobs. But Jamal doesn't want to be an engineer. He wants to help people. He also likes solving problems. He also likes building things. The test said pick one. The test didn't know what to do with someone who's all of it.

### STORY (Delivery Phase)

**Stage:** It's 3:47 PM. Jamal is sitting in the school library, avoiding going home. His mom asked again this morning: "Have you thought about what you're doing after graduation?" He hasn't. Not really. He's thought about it every day for three years, but he hasn't figured it out. The career fair is next month. He's supposed to have a plan. He doesn't have a plan. He has a list of things he's good at and a list of things he cares about, and they don't match any job description he's ever seen.

**Tension:** Every career tool asks him to know himself first. "What are your interests?" "What are your strengths?" But Jamal doesn't know. He's 17. He's still figuring it out. The tools assume he's already formed. They don't help him become. They just categorize what he already is. And if he doesn't fit the categories, the tool shrugs and says "try again."

**Opportunity:** LUX Story is a game. You don't answer questions about yourself. You make choices in conversations. You help characters solve problems. You build relationships. And as you play, patterns emerge. Not from a test. From your actions. You see yourself reflected in what you choose. And then you see careers that match those patterns. Not "you're analytical, here are 50 engineering jobs." More like: "You helped Maya navigate a difficult conversation, and you solved a technical problem for Devon. Here are careers where both matter."

**Resolution:** Jamal plays for 20 minutes. He makes 5 choices. He sees his pattern: high helping, high analytical, medium building. The game shows him careers he's never heard of: health informatics, community health coordinator, urban planning. He clicks on one. It shows him the skills he already has, the ones he's developing, and the ones he'd need to learn. It shows him Birmingham organizations doing this work. It doesn't tell him what to be. It shows him who he's becoming.

**Yes:** "Play for 20 minutes. Make 3 choices. See what patterns emerge. Then explore one career path that matches."

## For Educators / Counselors

### ABC (Design Phase)

**Act:** Assign LUX Story as a 30-minute exploration activity. Review student patterns in the admin dashboard.

**Believe:** "This isn't replacing me. It's giving me data I can actually use in a conversation."

**Care:** Ms. Rodriguez has 180 students. She's supposed to help each one figure out their path. But she gets 20 minutes per student per semester. She can't do discovery in 20 minutes. She can only do triage. So she defaults to: "What are you interested in?" They say "I don't know." She says "Well, what are you good at?" They say "I don't know." The conversation stalls. She sends them to a website with 500 careers. They get overwhelmed. They come back next semester with the same question.

### STORY (Delivery Phase)

**Stage:** It's 2:15 PM. Ms. Rodriguez is in her office. She just finished a 20-minute session with a student who said "I don't know" 12 times. She has 179 more students. The career fair is in three weeks. Half her students will show up with no plan, no questions, no direction. She'll spend the fair redirecting them from booths that don't match their interests, but she doesn't know their interests because they don't know their interests.

**Tension:** The tools exist. The assessments exist. But they're either too shallow (10 questions, generic results) or too deep (200 questions, students abandon halfway). And even when they complete them, the results are static. "You're analytical." Great. Now what? Ms. Rodriguez needs something that shows her not just what a student is, but what they're becoming. Something that gives her a starting point for a real conversation.

**Opportunity:** LUX Story generates patterns from gameplay. Not from answers. From choices. And the admin dashboard shows Ms. Rodriguez: Jamal has high helping, high analytical. He's explored 3 careers. He's unlocked 2 skills. He's building trust with Maya and Devon. Now when he comes in, she doesn't start with "what are you interested in?" She starts with "I see you've been exploring health informatics. What drew you to that?" The game did the discovery. She does the guidance.

**Resolution:** Ms. Rodriguez assigns LUX Story as a 30-minute exploration activity. She reviews the dashboard before each student meeting. She sees patterns, career interests, skill development. She walks into conversations with data. Not test results. Actual evidence of what students are exploring. The conversations shift from "I don't know" to "I've been thinking about this, and I have questions."

**Yes:** "Assign it as a 30-minute activity. Review the dashboard. Walk into your next student meeting with data."

## For Parents

### ABC (Design Phase)

**Act:** Your teen plays for 20 minutes. You see their patterns in a parent report. You have a conversation that doesn't start with "what do you want to be?"

**Believe:** "This isn't another screen time activity. It's helping them figure themselves out."

**Care:** Marcus's mom has been asking "what do you want to be?" since he was 14. He's 17 now. He still doesn't know. She's worried. College applications are due soon. Scholarships require declared majors. But Marcus doesn't want to declare anything. He doesn't know. She's tried career assessments. He did one, got "analytical," and said "that's not me." She's tried talking to him. He shuts down. She's running out of ways to help him figure it out without making him feel pressured.

### STORY (Delivery Phase)

**Stage:** It's 8:30 PM. Marcus's mom is sitting at the kitchen table. Marcus is in his room, probably on his phone. She's been trying to have "the conversation" for three years. It always ends the same way: she asks questions, he says "I don't know," she gets frustrated, he gets defensive. She wants to help. He wants space. They're stuck.

**Tension:** The pressure is real. College deadlines. Scholarship applications. But every attempt to help feels like pressure. Every career tool feels like a test. Every conversation feels like an interrogation. Marcus doesn't need more questions. He needs a way to explore without being judged.

**Opportunity:** LUX Story is a game. Marcus plays. He makes choices. He sees patterns emerge. He explores careers. And his mom gets a parent report. Not test results. Not "your child is analytical." More like: "Marcus has been exploring careers in community health and urban planning. He's building skills in communication and problem-solving. He's developing relationships with characters who value both helping others and solving complex problems." Now the conversation isn't "what do you want to be?" It's "I see you've been exploring community health. What's interesting about that?"

**Resolution:** Marcus plays for 20 minutes. His mom gets the report. She doesn't ask "what do you want to be?" She asks "I see you've been exploring urban planning. What drew you to that?" Marcus actually answers. He talks about the problems he wants to solve. He talks about the skills he's building. The conversation shifts from pressure to curiosity.

**Yes:** "Have them play for 20 minutes. Get the parent report. Start the next conversation with curiosity, not questions."

## The Interlock in Practice

| Audience | Care (ABC) | Stage + Tension (STORY) | Yes |
|----------|------------|--------------------------|-----|
| **Student (Jamal)** | Doesn't know who he is yet, but tools assume he does | Library, 3:47 PM, career fair next month + tools categorize instead of help him become | Play 20 min, make 3 choices, explore one career |
| **Educator (Ms. Rodriguez)** | 180 students, 20 min each, can't do discovery | Office, 2:15 PM, career fair in 3 weeks + students show up with no plan | Assign 30-min activity, review dashboard, walk in with data |
| **Parent (Marcus's mom)** | Wants to help but every attempt feels like pressure | Kitchen table, 8:30 PM, stuck in same conversation + pressure vs. space | Have them play, get report, start with curiosity |

## Using This Framework for LUX Story

1. **Write the Care first.** Name a person. Make them specific. What keeps them up at night?
   - Jamal: "I don't know who I am yet, but every tool assumes I do."
   - Ms. Rodriguez: "I can't do discovery in 20 minutes. I can only do triage."
   - Marcus's mom: "I want to help, but every attempt feels like pressure."

2. **Care becomes Stage + Tension.** Stage = set the scene, make them feel it. Tension = the conflict or challenge blocking them.
   - Stage: Library, 3:47 PM. Office, 2:15 PM. Kitchen table, 8:30 PM.
   - Tension: Tools assume you're already formed. Can't do discovery in 20 minutes. Pressure vs. space.

3. **Opportunity is your product/program.** Not features. The turning point that breaks the tension.
   - Not "it's a career exploration game."
   - More like: "You make choices. Patterns emerge. Careers match those patterns. Not from a test. From your actions."

4. **Resolution is their life after.** Not your success metrics. Their outcome.
   - Jamal: "He sees careers he's never heard of. It doesn't tell him what to be. It shows him who he's becoming."
   - Ms. Rodriguez: "She walks into conversations with data. Not test results. Actual evidence."
   - Marcus's mom: "The conversation shifts from pressure to curiosity."

5. **Yes is concrete.** Not "learn more." A specific next step they can take today.
   - "Play for 20 minutes. Make 3 choices. See what patterns emerge."
   - "Assign it as a 30-minute activity. Review the dashboard."
   - "Have them play. Get the report. Start the next conversation with curiosity."

## Key Insights for LUX Story Messaging

1. **It's not a test. It's a game.** This removes the pressure. Students aren't being evaluated. They're exploring.

2. **Patterns emerge from actions, not answers.** This is the core differentiator. You don't answer questions about yourself. You make choices. The patterns reveal themselves.

3. **It shows you who you're becoming, not who you are.** This addresses the core tension: students don't know themselves yet. The game helps them discover, not categorize.

4. **It gives educators data, not test results.** The dashboard shows patterns, career interests, skill development. Actionable data for real conversations.

5. **It shifts conversations from pressure to curiosity.** Parents and educators can start with "I see you've been exploring X" instead of "what do you want to be?"
