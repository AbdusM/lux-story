## The Secondary Cast (Audit in Progress)

| Character | Archetype | Proposed Career Path | Current Gap |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Alex** | The Rat | **Supply Chain & Logistics** | Missing from `2030-skills-system.ts`. |
| **Tess** | The Merchant | **Creative Entrepreneur** | Fits current def, but could be more specific (FinTech?). |
| **Grace** | The Doctor | **Healthcare Operations** | Fits `Healthcare Tech` broadly, but needs "Crisis Mgmt" nuance. |
| **Elena** | The Historian | **Information Science** | Could map to `Data Analyst`, but is more "Archivist". |
| **Silas** | The Mechanic | **Advanced Manufacturing** | Missing. Distinct from Construction (Kai) and Robotics (Maya). |
| **Zara** | The Artist | **Digital Media / Creative** | Fits `Creative Entrepreneur`. |
| **Lira** | The Voice | **Communications Strategy** | Missing. Focuses on "The Narrative" / PR. |

## Gap Analysis
We are missing 2 key distinct career pillars to cover the full "City within a Station" ecosystem:

1.  **Advanced Manufacturing & Logistics** (Alex/Silas)
    *   *Skills*: Systems Thinking, Triage, Technical Literacy.
    *   *Lesson*: "How things move" and "How to fix them."
2.  **Strategic Communications** (Lira/Asha)
    *   *Skills*: Storytelling, Cultural Competence, Media Literacy.
    *   *Lesson*: "How to shape the narrative."

## Action Plan
1.  Add **Advanced Logistics Specialist** to `2030-skills-system.ts` (For Alex).
2.  Update **Alex's Spec** to formalize his role as a "Logistics Savant."
3.  Confirm **Tess** uses the `Financial Literacy` skill triggers in her dialogue (Sector 2).
