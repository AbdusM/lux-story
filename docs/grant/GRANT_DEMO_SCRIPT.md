# Birmingham Catalyze Challenge - Demo Script
## 10-Minute Grant Demonstration

### Opening (1 minute)
"While others teach youth to chase careers, we help them discover careers already aligned with who they are."

**Problem**: Birmingham youth face crippling career anxiety. Traditional programs add pressure through tests and competition.

**Solution**: Lux offers contemplative career exploration - where youth discover paths through stillness, not striving.

### Questions We're Ready For

**Q: "How do you know it's working without tests?"**
A: "We track choice patterns. Players choosing 'helping' repeatedly show care orientation without answering 'Do you like helping people?'"

**Q: "What about students who need structure?"**
A: "The forest provides gentle structure through regions and characters, but no forced progression."

**Q: "How does this prepare them for real jobs?"**
A: "By reducing anxiety first, students can explore authentically. Our employer characters represent real Birmingham opportunities."

**Q: "What makes this different from game-based learning?"**
A: "No gamification. No points. No competition. Just contemplative exploration."
