**December 16, 2024 - Writing Rules for Grand Central Terminus**

## Part I: Writing Philosophy

### Joyce's Scrupulous Meanness
> "Every word must earn its place. Tight, spare, precise."

**The Principle:** Cut ruthlessly. The reader fills in what you don't say.

**Before/After Examples:**
| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| "Discover your interests, skills, and values through play." | "Play. Learn what moves you." |
| "Built on research. Designed by people who do this work." | "Research-backed. Practitioner-built." |
| "Real learning happens when you're uncomfortable" | "Sounds like it pushes people. Hard." |

**Words to Cut:**
- "In order to" → "to"
- "The fact that" → (delete)
- "Very" → (delete or find stronger word)
- "Just" → (delete)
- "That" → (delete when possible)

**Writing Checklist:**
- [ ] Can any word be cut without losing meaning?
- [ ] Are there abstract nouns that could be concrete?
- [ ] Is there a simpler word?
- [ ] Does every adjective pull weight?

---

### Humanize Player Voice
> "Peer discovering alongside, not wise mentor."

**The Principle:** Players are fellow travelers, not therapists or coaches.

| Before (Therapist Voice) | After (Peer Voice) |
|--------------------------|-------------------|
| "Real learning happens when you're uncomfortable" | "Sounds like it pushes people. Hard." |
| "You don't have to choose between engineer and son. Be both." | "What if you don't have to pick?" |
| "The system worked for the company. It failed the human." | "The paperwork protected them. Not him." |

**What to Remove:**
- Coaching axioms and reframing
- Leading questions
- "Wise mentor" pronouncements
- Inspirational quotes in dialogue

---

### Remove Meta-Framing
> Stay in fiction. Never remind players they're in a game or learning tool.

**What to Remove:**
- Coaching language
- Inspirational quotes in UI
- Game-meta text ("You've completed...")
- Stage directions in dialogue (`*nods*`, `[looks away]`)
- Therapist-style axioms

**What to Use Instead:**
- Actionable career guidance
- Simplified descriptions
- Pure dialogue (no brackets)
- In-world language

---

### Show, Don't Tell

**Current Pattern (Telling):**
```
"Maya seems nervous about sharing this."
```

**Enhanced Pattern (Showing):**
```
Maya's fingers trace the edge of the counter, back and forth.
"It's just... there's this thing I haven't told anyone."
Her eyes flick to the door, then back to you.
```

**Implementation Guidelines:**

1. **Emotion Through Body Language**
   - Trust up: "Something in Maya's posture relaxes."
   - Trust down: "Devon's eyes flicker away for a moment."
   - Curiosity: "Kai tilts their head, studying you with new interest."

2. **The Five Senses Rule** - Every emotional state engages at least two senses
   - Visual + Auditory: "The station hums differently here. Warmer."
   - Tactile + Visual: "Cold metal bench. She's been sitting here a while."

3. **Environment as Mirror** - Let setting reflect character states
   - Character anxious? "The fluorescent light above flickers, just slightly."
   - Character opening up? "Afternoon light spills through the window."

## Part II: Character Voice Templates

### Voice Framework
Each character must have:
1. **Signature Pacing** - How fast/slow they speak
2. **Vocabulary Domain** - What words they default to
3. **Sentence Structure** - Long/short, questions/statements
4. **Verbal Tics** - Repeated phrases (1-2 max)
5. **Cultural References** - What they relate things to

### Character Voice Guide

**Samuel (Hub/Mentor)**
- Pacing: Measured, with thoughtful pauses
- Vocabulary: Observational, nature metaphors, station history
- Structure: Often begins with observations before conclusions
- Tic: "The station remembers..."
- Sample: "The thing about waiting... it teaches you what matters. Watch people long enough, you see their whole story in how they walk."

**Maya (Tech Innovator)**
- Pacing: Variable - fast when excited, slow when uncertain
- Vocabulary: Creative, visual metaphors, emotional language
- Structure: Often trails off, restarts
- Tic: "It's like..."
- Sample: "It's like... you know when you're painting and suddenly it's not what you planned but it's *right*? That. But with my whole life."

**Devon (Systems Thinker)**
- Pacing: Rapid when explaining, abrupt pauses to think
- Vocabulary: Technical, systematic, efficiency-focused
- Structure: Declarative statements, precise qualifiers
- Tic: "Technically speaking..."
- Sample: "Technically speaking, the probability of running into you here was negligible. Which makes this either statistically fascinating or—" *pause* "—meaningful."

**Jordan (Career Navigator)**
- Pacing: Relaxed, unhurried
- Vocabulary: Philosophical, direction/journey metaphors
- Structure: Questions more than statements
- Tic: "What if..."
- Sample: "What if getting lost is the only way to find where you actually need to be?"

**Marcus (Medical Tech)**
- Pacing: Steady, workman-like
- Vocabulary: Concrete, physical, practical
- Structure: Short, direct sentences
- Tic: "The thing is..."
- Sample: "The thing is, you can plan all you want. But sometimes you just have to start building and trust the structure will hold."

**Kai (Safety Specialist)**
- Pacing: Warm, inclusive rhythms
- Vocabulary: Relationship-focused, community terms
- Structure: Often references others, brings people in
- Tic: "Between us..."
- Sample: "Between us, I think everyone here is looking for the same thing. Connection."

**Tess (Education Founder)**
- Pacing: Crisp, no wasted words
- Vocabulary: Strategic, game/competition terms
- Structure: Cause-and-effect, if-then
- Tic: "Here's the play..."
- Sample: "Here's the play: you've got maybe two options that matter. Everything else is noise."

**Yaquin (EdTech Creator)**
- Pacing: Flowing, almost musical
- Vocabulary: Abstract, possibility-focused, imaginative
- Structure: Long, winding sentences that circle back
- Tic: "Imagine..."
- Sample: "Imagine if every station was a story, and every traveler was a character in everyone else's narrative."

**Rohan (Deep Tech)**
- Pacing: Deliberate, contemplative
- Vocabulary: Philosophical, existential questions
- Structure: Statements that invite reflection
- Sample: "Some questions don't have answers. That's what makes them worth asking."

## Part III: Four-Part Character Arc

### Structure Overview
1. **Introduction** (Nodes 1-10): Hook, context, surface conflict
2. **Crossroads** (Nodes 11-20): Key decision point + pressure test
3. **Challenge** (Nodes 21-30): Ethical dilemma + vulnerability
4. **Insight** (Nodes 31-35): Unexpected moment + resolution

**Why This Works:**
- Mobile-friendly pacing (10 nodes = 1 session = 10-15 min)
- Pattern revelation through choices, not exposition
- Emotional arc (curious → challenged → vulnerable → transformed)
- Replayability (different choices = different understanding)

---

### Act 1: Introduction (Nodes 1-10)

**Node 1: Hook** (Trust 0)
- Immediate intrigue or relatable problem
- Make player curious
- 4 choices (one per relevant pattern)

**Nodes 2-3: Context** (Trust 0-1)
- Who they are, what they do, where they are
- Show, don't tell (details reveal profession)

**Nodes 4-6: Surface Conflict** (Trust 1-2)
- Low-stakes problem that reveals personality
- Player helps solve or observes

**Nodes 7-9: Pattern Introduction** (Trust 2-3)
- First glimpse of deeper themes
- Character hints at bigger question

**Node 10: Bridge to Act 2** (Trust 3)
- **SESSION BOUNDARY** - Natural pause point
- Question or decision leading to crossroads

---

### Act 2: Crossroads (Nodes 11-20)

**The Crossroads (Nodes 11-14)**
```
"I'm at a decision point. Option A vs Option B. Both valid. Both costly."
```

**Crossroads Principles:**
- No "right" answer
- Both options have merit AND cost
- Choice reveals values, not competence
- Character reflects player's perspective

**Example (Dr. Amara - AI Diagnostician):**
> "The AI flagged a shadow. 99.2% confidence: benign. But something feels off."
>
> Choices:
> - "Trust your gut. Order the tests." (Patience + Analytical)
> - "The AI's track record speaks for itself." (Analytical)
> - "Talk to the patient. Let them decide." (Helping)
> - "What specifically feels off?" (Exploring)

**Day-in-Life Pressure Test (Nodes 15-18)**
- Reveal HOW player prioritizes under constraints
- Time pressure, competing demands
- No winning move—only trade-offs

**Node 20: Bridge to Act 3**
- **SESSION BOUNDARY**
- Consequence preview

---

### Act 3: Challenge (Nodes 21-30)

**The Dilemma (Nodes 21-24)**
- Values conflict, no perfect answer
- Example: "The AI was wrong. Patient has cancer. Do I report the error?"

**Vulnerability Reveal (Nodes 25-28)**
- Trust 5+ required to unlock
- Character shows authentic self
- What they've never told anyone

**Node 30: Bridge to Insight**
- **SESSION BOUNDARY**
- Stakes clearly established

---

### Act 4: Insight (Nodes 31-35)

**Unexpected Moment (Nodes 31-33)**
- Surprise that reframes everything
- Shows character in new light

**Resolution (Nodes 34-35)**
- Character transformed (or not, based on player choices)
- Reflection that acknowledges player's influence
- Open loop for future

---

## Part IV: Pattern Reflection Writing

### Target: 20% Acknowledgment Rate
Currently: 4.4% (50 of 1,142 pattern-tagged choices)
Target: 20% (~230 pattern reflections)

### Pattern Reflection Template
```typescript
patternReflection: [
  { pattern: 'analytical', minLevel: 4,
    altText: "Character-specific acknowledgment of analytical pattern" }
]
```

### Examples by Character

**Samuel:**
```
patience: "You don't rush to fill silences. That's rare."
analytical: "You're still processing, aren't you? Good."
helping: "You listen in a way that makes people feel heard."
exploring: "Questions like those—they're what the station was built for."
building: "You think in solutions. I've seen that before."
```

**Maya:**
```
building: "You think like a maker. I can tell."
helping: "You actually care. That's... not common."
analytical: "You see through the surface stuff, don't you?"
patience: "Most people would have interrupted by now."
exploring: "You ask the questions I forget to ask myself."
```

**Devon:**
```
analytical: "You see the system, not just the symptoms."
patience: "Most people would have interrupted by now."
building: "You're already designing solutions in your head, aren't you?"
exploring: "That's the right question. Most people miss it."
helping: "You actually care about the human part, not just the problem."
```

---

## Part V: Pattern Sensations

**Layer 2 of the Three-Layer Reflection System.**

Sensations are FELT, not TOLD. Internal, bodily, intuitive.

| Pattern | Sensation |
|---------|-----------|
| analytical | "Something clicks into place." |
| patience | "You let the moment breathe." |
| exploring | "Curiosity pulls at you." |
| helping | "Something in you reaches out." |
| building | "Your hands itch to make it real." |

**Trigger:** 30% chance after pattern choice
**Duration:** Fades after 3 seconds
**Style:** Atmospheric text, not notification

---

## Part VI: Session Boundary Placement

### Rules
- **Session boundary every 10 nodes** (approximately)
- Only at `canBoundary: true` nodes
- Never mid-vulnerability reveal
- Never after high-stakes choice (let it breathe)

### Boundary Types
| Type | When | Example |
|------|------|---------|
| `natural` | End of conversation thread | "Maya glances at the clock." |
| `cliffhanger` | Before big reveal | "There's something I haven't told anyone." |
| `resolution` | After emotional beat | "Thanks for listening. Really." |

### Boundary Announcement Style
```
─────────────────────────────────
🚂 THE PLATFORM QUIETS AS EVENING SETTLES
─────────────────────────────────

Three figures wait on the platform:
• Maya leans against the information booth
• Devon debugs something near Track 3
• Samuel watches the departures board

Who will you visit next?
```

---

## Part VII: Dialogue Mechanics

### Strip Extras First
> "When revising dialogue, strip back everything. Remove tags, adverbs, action beats. Let the dialogue stand alone."

**Before:**
```
"I understand," Maya said sympathetically, nodding her head slowly.
"That must be really hard for you."
```

**After:**
```
"That must be heavy to carry."
Maya's hand moves toward yours, stops halfway.
```

### Choice Writing Rules

1. **Each choice tracks exactly ONE pattern**
2. **No "right" answer—only trade-offs**
3. **All choices lead somewhere different** (or get different acknowledgment)
4. **Player voice is peer, not therapist**
5. **Choices reveal values, not competence**

### Choice Structure
```typescript
choices: [
  { text: 'Observant/analytical response', pattern: 'analytical' },
  { text: 'Supportive/caring response', pattern: 'helping' },
  { text: 'Curious/questioning response', pattern: 'exploring' },
  { text: 'Patient/building response', pattern: 'patience' | 'building' }
]
```

---

## Part VIII: Station Atmosphere

### The Station Breathes
When player pauses, life continues around them.

**Event Timing:**
```typescript
FIRST_IDLE_MS: 12000     // 12 seconds before first event
SUBSEQUENT_IDLE_MS: 18000 // 18 seconds between events
MAX_IDLE_EVENTS: 3        // Then silence
```

**Writing Rules:**
1. One sentence, one observation
2. Show, don't tell - "A woman rushes past" not "The station is busy"
3. Specific details - "leather bag, heels clicking" not "with luggage"
4. No player action required
5. Varied senses - Mix visual, auditory, olfactory, tactile

**Examples:**
- "A man in a rumpled suit checks his watch for the third time."
- "The coffee cart vendor whistles something half-remembered."
- "Pigeons scatter as a train announces its arrival."
- "Someone drops a paperback. It lands face-down, spine cracking."

## Part IX: Quick Reference Checklist

### Before Submitting Dialogue
- [ ] Every word earns its place (Joyce's Meanness)
- [ ] Player voice is peer, not therapist
- [ ] No meta-framing or coaching language
- [ ] Show emotions through body language
- [ ] Character voice is distinctive
- [ ] Choices track exactly ONE pattern
- [ ] No fake choices (all lead somewhere different)
- [ ] Session boundaries at natural pauses
- [ ] Pattern reflections for high-impact nodes

### Red Flags
- "You've completed..." (meta-framing)
- `*nods*` or `[looks away]` (stage directions)
- "What I hear you saying is..." (therapist voice)
- "The thing is, you need to..." (coaching)
- Long explanatory paragraphs (show, don't tell)
- All choices leading to same node (fake choice)
