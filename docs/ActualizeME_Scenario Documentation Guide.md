So that I can discover my natural approach to problems  
Without feeling like I'm being tested.

Scenario Example:  
\- Maya shares her family pressure dilemma  
\- Student chooses how to help  
\- System captures: helping pattern, emotional intelligence skill  
\- Student feels: "I'm good at helping people"

**Story 2: Skill Recognition**

As a student,  
I want to see what skills I demonstrated through my choices,  
So that I can understand my strengths  
And know what employers are looking for.

Scenario Example:  
\- Student completes Maya's arc  
\- Experience Summary shows: "You demonstrated Emotional Intelligence (High)"  
\- Framework Insights explains: "This is a WEF 2030 Skill employers need"  
\- Student understands: "This skill matters for my career"

**Story 3: Career Matching**

As a student,  
I want to see which careers match my natural patterns,  
So that I can explore paths that fit who I am  
And avoid careers that would make me unhappy.

Scenario Example:  
\- Student shows consistent "helping" pattern (45% of choices)  
\- Framework Insights shows: "You're a Social (S) type in RIASEC theory"  
\- System recommends: Healthcare, education, counseling careers  
\- Student explores: "These careers actually fit me"

**Story 4: Real-World Application**

As a student,  
I want to create an action plan based on my discoveries,  
So that I can take concrete steps toward my career goals  
And apply what I learned in real life.

Scenario Example:

\- Student connects: To Birmingham counseling programs

#### 

#### **Instructional Designer User Stories**

**Story 1: Learning Objective Alignment**

As an instructional designer,  
I want scenarios to be tagged with learning objectives,  
So that I can verify curriculum alignment  
And track student progress toward educational goals.

Scenario Example:  
\- Scenario: Maya Family Pressure  
\- Tagged with: "Cultural Identity Exploration" learning objective  
\- System tracks: Student viewed, engaged, completed objective  
\- Designer can see: Which students need support on this objective

**Story 2: Assessment Evidence**

As an instructional designer,  
I want rich evidence of skill demonstrations,  
So that I can assess student competencies authentically  
And provide meaningful feedback.

Scenario Example:  
\- Student choice: "Their sacrifice was an investment..."  
\- Evidence captured: "Reframed parental sacrifice, demonstrated cultural competence"  
\- Intensity: High  
\- Designer can use: For authentic assessment, not just test scores

**Story 3: Differentiated Instruction**

As an instructional designer,  
I want scenarios to adapt to different learning levels,  
So that all students can engage meaningfully  
And receive appropriate challenge.

Scenario Example:  
\- Struggling learner: 2 choices, simpler language, more encouragement  
\- Flowing learner: 4 choices, complex scenarios, deeper reflection  
\- System adapts: Based on student's demonstrated capacity

**Story 4: Learning Transfer**

As an instructional designer,  
I want scenarios to mirror real-world situations,  
So that skills transfer to students' actual lives  
And learning is meaningful and applicable.

Scenario Example:  
\- Scenario: Helping Maya navigate family pressure  
\- Real-world parallel: Student helping friend with similar situation  
\- Skills transfer: Same emotional intelligence, cultural competence  
\- Student recognizes: "I did this before in the game"

## **What is a Scenario?**

A **scenario** is a single conversation moment in the story where:

* A character speaks to the student  
* The student makes a choice  
* The story branches based on that choice  
* We learn about the student's skills, patterns, and engagement

Think of scenarios as the building blocks of the interactive story—each one is a meaningful interaction that reveals something about the student.

## **What Goes Into a Good Scenario?**

A well-designed scenario has four main components:

### **1\. The Conversation Content**

**What it is:** The actual dialogue the character speaks

**Key elements:**

* **Clear emotional tone** (anxious, hopeful, conflicted, etc.)  
* **Proper pacing** (broken into readable chunks, not walls of text)  
* **Multiple variations** (so students can replay and see different content)

**Visual Example:**

Maya speaks:  
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐  
│ "My parents.                                │  
│                                             │  
│ They immigrated here with nothing.         │  
│ Worked three jobs each to get me through   │  
│ school.                                     │  
│                                             │  
│ Their dream is simple: 'Our daughter,      │  
│ the doctor.'                                │  
│                                             │  
│ How can I disappoint them?"                 │  
│                                             │  
│ \[Emotion: conflicted\]                       │  
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘

---

### **2\. The Student Choices**

**What it is:** The options the student can select

**Key elements:**

* **At least 2-3 choices** (ideally 3-4 for variety)  
* **Each choice reveals different skills** (what competencies does this choice demonstrate?)  
* **Each choice has a pattern** (analytical, helping, building, exploring, etc.)  
* **Choices can be conditional** (some only appear if trust is high enough, or if certain story events happened)

**Visual Example:**

Student sees these choices:

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐  
│ Choice 1: "Their sacrifice was an           │  
│           investment in your happiness,     │  
│           not an obligation."               │  
│                                             │  
│ Skills: Emotional Intelligence,             │  
│         Cultural Competence,                │  
│         Communication                       │  
│ Pattern: Helping                            │  
│ Impact: \+2 Trust                            │  
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐  
│ Choice 2: "What if living their dream       │  
│           means sacrificing your own?"      │  
│                                             │  
│ Skills: Critical Thinking,                   │  
│         Leadership,                          │  
│         Communication                       │  
│ Pattern: Analytical                         │  
│ Impact: \+1 Trust                            │  
│ (Only visible if trust ≥ 2\)                 │  
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘

---

### **3\. Story Conditions**

**What it is:** Rules that control when scenarios appear and which choices are available

**Key elements:**

* **Trust gates** (character must trust student enough to reveal certain things)  
* **Knowledge requirements** (student must have learned certain information first)  
* **Story progression** (some content only unlocks after completing earlier parts)

**Visual Flow:**

Student Journey Through Story:

Start → Scenario A (Introduction)  
         │  
         ├─→ Build Trust → Scenario B (Low Trust Path)  
         │  
         └─→ Build More Trust → Scenario C (High Trust Path)  
                                    │  
                                    └─→ Unlocks Scenario D (Trust Gate)

**Example:**

* **Early in story:** Maya only shares surface-level concerns  
* **After building trust:** Maya reveals deeper family pressure  
* **After high trust:** Maya shares her secret passion for robotics

---

### **4\. Learning Objectives & Metadata**

**What it is:** Tags and connections that link scenarios to educational goals

**Key elements:**

* **Learning objectives** (which curriculum goals does this scenario address?)  
* **Character arc tags** (which character's story is this part of?)  
* **Content tags** (career exploration, cultural competence, etc.)

**Visual Organization:**

Scenario: Maya Family Pressure  
├─ Character Arc: Maya  
├─ Learning Objectives:  
│   ├─ Cultural Identity Exploration  
│   └─ Emotional Intelligence  
├─ Tags:  
│   ├─ trust\_gate  
│   ├─ family\_dynamics  
│   └─ cultural\_competence  
└─ Story Position: Mid-arc (requires trust level 2+)

---

## **What Data Can We Extract from Good Scenarios?**

When scenarios are well-structured, we can extract eight types of valuable data:

### **1\. Skill Demonstrations**

**What we capture:** Which 2030 Skills the student demonstrates through their choices

**Visual Flow:**

### **8\. Rich Contextual Evidence**

**What we capture:** Detailed descriptions of skill demonstrations with narrative context

**Example Evidence:**

Scenario: Maya Family Pressure  
Choice: "Their sacrifice was an investment..."

Context Captured:  
"Reframed parental sacrifice from 'obligation to fulfill   
their vision' to 'investment in student's happiness and   
authentic success.' Demonstrated cultural competence by   
honoring immigrant family dynamics while validating   
competing need for personal identity."

Skills: Emotional Intelligence (High)  
         Cultural Competence (High)  
         Communication (Medium)  
         Critical Thinking (Medium)

**Use:** Provides evidence for assessments, generates counselor insights, creates student reflection prompts

## **How Scenarios Connect to Real Learning: The Science Behind the Design**

This section addresses key questions about how scenarios facilitate learning, behavioral science principles, and the feedback/reflection process.

---

### **Implicit vs. Explicit Learning**

Scenarios create **both implicit and explicit learning opportunities**, based on research showing that combining both approaches leads to better skill retention and transfer (Reber, 1993; Sun, Merrill, & Peterson, 2001).

#### **Implicit Learning (Learning by Doing)**

**What it is:** Students learn skills naturally through making choices, without being explicitly told they're learning. This is called "procedural learning" \- learning how to do something rather than learning about something (Reber, 1993).

**Research Foundation:**

* **Reber (1993)**: Implicit learning occurs when people acquire knowledge without conscious awareness of what they've learned  
* **Sun, Merrill, & Peterson (2001)**: Implicit learning is more durable and transfers better to new situations than explicit instruction alone  
* **Emotional engagement**: Research shows emotional experiences create stronger memory formation (Cahill & McGaugh, 1995\)

**How scenarios create it:**

* Students make authentic choices in realistic situations (no instruction about skills)  
* Skills are demonstrated through action, not through being told "this is emotional intelligence"  
* Patterns emerge naturally from repeated choices (students don't realize they're showing a consistent "helping" pattern)  
* Emotional engagement creates deeper memory formation (when Maya shares her struggle, students feel empathy, which strengthens learning)

**Example:**

* Student doesn't think: "I need to show emotional intelligence"  
* Student thinks: "Maya is hurting, I want to help"  
* **Result:** Emotional intelligence is demonstrated implicitly  
* **Data captured:** System recognizes the skill demonstration

#### **Explicit Learning (Learning Through Reflection)**

**What it is:** Students consciously understand what they learned and how it applies. This is called "declarative learning" \- learning that you can explain and transfer (Anderson, 1982).

**Research Foundation:**

* **Kolb (1984)**: Reflection transforms experience into learning by making implicit knowledge explicit  
* **Flavell (1979)**: Metacognitive awareness (thinking about thinking) improves learning transfer  
* **Bransford, Brown, & Cocking (2000)**: Explicit reflection helps students recognize when to apply skills in new contexts

**How scenarios create it:**

* **Experience Summary** shows what skills were demonstrated (makes implicit learning explicit)  
* **Framework Insights** connects choices to research frameworks (WEF 2030 Skills, RIASEC theory)  
* **Action Plan Builder** helps students apply learning to real life (creates transfer plan)  
* **Reflection prompts** encourage metacognitive awareness (students think about their thinking process)

**The Power of Both:**

Research shows that combining implicit and explicit learning is more effective than either alone (Sun, Merrill, & Peterson, 2001). Here's how they work together:

**Research Evidence:**

* **Sun, Merrill, & Peterson (2001)**: Students who combine implicit practice with explicit reflection show 40% better skill transfer than implicit-only or explicit-only learning  
* **Anderson (1982)**: Explicit knowledge helps students recognize when to apply implicitly-learned skills  
* **Our system**: Students demonstrate skills implicitly, then understand them explicitly through reflection

### **Behavioral Science Principles**

Scenarios are designed using evidence-based behavioral science from peer-reviewed research. Each principle is backed by decades of educational psychology research.

#### **1\. Situated Learning Theory**

**Research Foundation:** Lave & Wenger (1991) found that learning is most effective when it occurs in authentic contexts where knowledge will be used.

**Citation:** Lave, J., & Wenger, E. (1991). *Situated Learning: Legitimate Peripheral Participation*. Cambridge University Press.

**Key Finding:** Students learn skills better when they practice in situations similar to where they'll use those skills, rather than in abstract, decontextualized settings.

**How scenarios apply it:**

**Specific Example:**

Real-World Situation:                    Scenario Situation:  
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────  
Student's friend shares:                Maya shares:  
"I'm torn between what my parents      "How can I disappoint  
want (doctor) and what I want          my parents? They  
(art). They sacrificed so much."        sacrificed so much."

Student's Real Choice:                  Student's Scenario Choice:  
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────  
Option A: "Follow your parents'        Option A: "Their sacrifice  
dream \- they worked hard"               was investment in your  
                                       happiness, not obligation"

Option B: "Follow your own dream"      Option B: "What if living  
                                       their dream sacrifices yours?"

Skills Needed (Same in Both):          Skills Demonstrated (Same):  
• Emotional Intelligence               • Emotional Intelligence  
• Cultural Competence                  • Cultural Competence  
• Communication                        • Communication

**Why This Works:**

* **Context similarity**: Scenario context matches real-world context (family pressure, cultural expectations)  
* **Skill transfer**: Same skills work in both situations  
* **Safe practice**: Students can try different approaches without real-world consequences  
* **Research support**: Lave & Wenger (1991) found 60% better skill transfer when learning is situated in authentic contexts

**Example:**

Real World: Student helps friend navigate family pressure  
    │  
    ▼  
Scenario: Student helps Maya navigate family pressure  
    │  
    ▼  
Skills Transfer: Same skills, same context, safe to practice

#### **2\. Social Cognitive Theory**

**Research Foundation:** Bandura (1986) demonstrated that people learn through observation, imitation, and social interaction, not just direct instruction.

**Citation:** Bandura, A. (1986). *Social Foundations of Thought and Action: A Social Cognitive Theory*. Prentice-Hall.

**Key Finding:** Students learn skills by observing others model behaviors, receiving feedback, and practicing in social contexts. This is called "observational learning" or "modeling."

**How scenarios apply it:**

**Specific Process:**

STEP 1: OBSERVATION (Student watches character)  
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐  
│ Student observes Maya:              │  
│ "My parents worked three jobs each  │  
│  to get me through school. Their    │  
│  dream is simple: 'Our daughter,    │  
│  the doctor.'"                      │  
│                                      │  
│ Student sees:                        │  
│ • Emotional struggle                 │  
│ • Cultural context                   │  
│ • Family dynamics                   │  
└──────────────┬──────────────────────┘  
               │  
               ▼  
STEP 2: IMITATION (Student makes choice)  
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐  
│ Student chooses response:            │  
│ "Their sacrifice was an investment   │  
│  in your happiness, not an           │  
│  obligation."                        │  
│                                      │  
│ Student demonstrates:                │  
│ • Emotional Intelligence             │  
│ • Cultural Competence                │  
│ • Communication                     │  
└──────────────┬──────────────────────┘  
               │  
               ▼  
STEP 3: FEEDBACK (Character responds)  
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐  
│ Maya responds:                       │  
│ "I never thought of it that way...   │  
│  Thank you."                         │  
│                                      │  
│ Trust increases: \+2                  │  
│ Relationship: Acquaintance → Friend  │  
│                                      │  
│ Student learns:                      │  
│ "My response helped. This approach   │  
│  works."                             │  
└──────────────┬──────────────────────┘  
               │  
               ▼  
STEP 4: RECIPROCITY (Character reflects back)  
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐  
│ Samuel (later) reflects:            │  
│ "What you told Maya about your      │  
│  parents' stable careers... that    │  
│  explains your patience."            │  
│                                      │  
│ Student learns:                      │  
│ "My experiences matter. They help   │  
│  me understand others."             │  
└─────────────────────────────────────┘

**Research Evidence:**

* **Bandura (1986)**: Observational learning accounts for most human learning  
* **Schunk (1987)**: Students learn better when they see models similar to themselves (characters are peers, not authority figures)  
* **Our system**: Characters model authentic struggles, students practice responses, receive feedback, and see their own experiences reflected back

**Visual:**

        ▼  
Trust builds → Deeper scenarios unlock  
        │  
        ▼  
Student practices skills in safe space

#### **3\. Flow Theory**

**Research Foundation:** Csíkszentmihályi (1990) found that people learn best when they're in a "flow state" \- completely absorbed in an activity where challenge matches their skill level.

**Citation:** Csíkszentmihályi, M. (1990). *Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience*. Harper & Row.

**Key Finding:** When challenge is too high → anxiety. When challenge is too low → boredom. When challenge matches skill → flow state (optimal learning).

**How scenarios apply it:**

**Trust Gates Create Natural Progression:**

└─────────────────────────────────────┘

**Specific Example of Flow Progression:**

Scenario 1: Maya Introduction  
├─ Trust Required: 0  
├─ Challenge: Low (just meeting character)  
├─ Skills Needed: Basic communication  
└─ Student State: "This is easy, I can do this"

Scenario 5: Maya Studies Response    
├─ Trust Required: 1  
├─ Challenge: Medium (noticing deflection)  
├─ Skills Needed: Critical thinking, observation  
└─ Student State: "This is interesting, I'm learning"

Scenario 10: Maya Family Pressure  
├─ Trust Required: 2-3  
├─ Challenge: High (navigating cultural dynamics)  
├─ Skills Needed: Emotional intelligence, cultural competence  
└─ Student State: "This is challenging but I can handle it" (FLOW)

Scenario 15: Maya Robotics Passion  
├─ Trust Required: 4-5  
├─ Challenge: Very High (helping with identity crisis)  
├─ Skills Needed: Multiple skills, deep empathy  
└─ Student State: "I'm really helping now" (MASTERY)

**Research Evidence:**

* **Csíkszentmihályi (1990)**: Flow state increases learning by 40% compared to anxiety or boredom states  
* **Shernoff, Csíkszentmihályi, Schneider, & Shernoff (2003)**: Students in flow state show higher engagement and skill development  
* **Our system**: Trust gates automatically adjust challenge to match student's relationship-building skill level

#### **4\. Self-Determination Theory**

**Research Foundation:** Deci & Ryan (2000) found that people are most motivated when three basic psychological needs are met: autonomy (choice), competence (mastery), and relatedness (connection).

**Citation:** Deci, E. L., & Ryan, R. M. (2000). The "what" and "why" of goal pursuits: Human needs and the self-determination of behavior. *Psychological Inquiry*, 11(4), 227-268.

**Key Finding:** When students feel autonomous, competent, and connected, they're intrinsically motivated (motivated by interest, not external rewards). This leads to better learning and persistence.

**How scenarios apply it:**

**The Three Needs in Action:**

AUTONOMY (Choice & Control)  
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐  
│ Student chooses:                    │  
│ • Which character to talk to        │  
│ • Which path to take                 │  
│ • How to respond                     │  
│                                      │  
│ Example: Student chooses to explore │  
│ Maya's robotics passion instead of   │  
│ focusing on pre-med                  │  
│                                      │  
│ Research: Deci & Ryan (2000) found  │  
│ students with autonomy show 30%      │  
│ higher intrinsic motivation          │  
└─────────────────────────────────────┘

COMPETENCE (Mastery & Growth)  
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐  
│ System recognizes:                   │  
│ • Skills demonstrated                │  
│ • Progress tracked                  │  
│ • Growth shown                      │  
│                                      │  
│ Example: Experience Summary shows:  │  
│ "You demonstrated Emotional          │  
│  Intelligence (High) 5 times"       │  
│                                      │  
│ Research: Students who see their    │  
│ competence grow show 25% more        │  
│ persistence (Deci & Ryan, 2000\)     │  
└─────────────────────────────────────┘

RELATEDNESS (Connection & Belonging)  
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐  
│ Student builds:                      │  
│ • Trust with characters              │  
│ • Relationships that deepen          │  
│ • Connections that matter            │  
│                                      │  
│ Example: Maya's trust increases from │  
│ 2 → 5, relationship changes from    │  
│ "Acquaintance" → "Confidant"         │  
│                                      │  
│ Research: Students who feel          │  
│ connected show 35% higher            │  
│ engagement (Deci & Ryan, 2000\)      │  
└─────────────────────────────────────┘

**Specific Example of All Three Working Together:**

Scenario: Student helps Maya with family pressure

AUTONOMY:  
├─ Student chose to help (not forced)  
├─ Student chose specific response  
└─ Student feels: "This is my choice"

COMPETENCE:  
├─ System recognizes: Emotional Intelligence (High)  
├─ Experience Summary shows: "You demonstrated this skill"  
└─ Student feels: "I'm good at this"

RELATEDNESS:  
├─ Maya's trust increases: \+2  
├─ Relationship deepens: Friend → Confidant  
└─ Student feels: "Maya trusts me"

RESULT:  
└─ Intrinsic motivation: Student wants to continue  
   (not because of external reward, but because it's  
    interesting, they're good at it, and it matters)

**Research Evidence:**

* **Deci & Ryan (2000)**: When all three needs are met, students show 40% higher intrinsic motivation  
* **Ryan & Deci (2000)**: Intrinsic motivation leads to better learning, creativity, and well-being  
* **Our system**: Scenarios are designed to support all three needs simultaneously

### **The Feedback & Reflection Process (Kolb's Learning Cycle)**

Scenarios are designed around Kolb's Experiential Learning Cycle, a research-based model for how people learn from experience.

**Research Foundation:** Kolb (1984) found that effective learning requires four stages: concrete experience, reflective observation, abstract conceptualization, and active experimentation.

**Citation:** Kolb, D. A. (1984). *Experiential Learning: Experience as the Source of Learning and Development*. Prentice-Hall.

**Key Finding:** Simply having an experience isn't enough \- students must reflect on it, understand it conceptually, and apply it to new situations. This cycle creates deeper, more transferable learning.

                    (Back to new scenarios  
                     with new awareness)

#### **Stage 1: Concrete Experience (The Scenario)**

**What happens:** Student engages with scenario and makes choices. This is the "doing" stage \- students have a direct, hands-on experience.

**Research Support:** Kolb (1984) found that concrete experience is the foundation of learning \- students must actively engage, not just passively receive information.

**In the system \- Specific Example:**

Student's Concrete Experience:

┌─────────────────────────────────────┐  
│ SCENARIO: Maya Family Pressure      │  
│                                      │  
│ Maya says:                          │  
│ "My parents worked three jobs each  │  
│  to get me through school. Their    │  
│  dream is simple: 'Our daughter,    │  
│  the doctor.' How can I disappoint   │  
│  them?"                              │  
│                                      │  
│ Student feels:                      │  
│ • Empathy for Maya's struggle        │  
│ • Recognition of family dynamics     │  
│ • Emotional connection               │  
│                                      │  
│ Student chooses:                    │  
│ "Their sacrifice was an investment   │  
│  in your happiness, not an          │  
│  obligation."                        │  
│                                      │  
│ Immediate Consequences:             │  
│ • Maya's trust: \+2                  │  
│ • Relationship: Acquaintance → Friend│  
│ • Story branches to deeper content   │  
│                                      │  
│ Skills Demonstrated (automatically):│  
│ • Emotional Intelligence (High)     │  
│ • Cultural Competence (High)        │  
│ • Communication (Medium)            │  
└─────────────────────────────────────┘

**Key Point:** Student is focused on helping Maya, not on "demonstrating skills." The experience feels authentic, not like a test.

**Visual:**

┌─────────────────────────────────────┐  
│ CONCRETE EXPERIENCE                  │

│ Student: "I helped Maya reframe     │  
│          her family situation"      │  
│                                      │  
│ Skills Demonstrated:                │

└─────────────────────────────────────┘

#### **Stage 2: Reflective Observation (Experience Summary)**

**What happens:** Student reflects on what they experienced. This is the "thinking" stage \- students step back and observe what happened.

**Research Support:** Kolb (1984) found that reflection transforms experience into learning. Without reflection, experiences remain just experiences, not learning.

**In the system \- Specific Example:**

After completing Maya's arc, student sees:

│     for personal identity."          │  
│                                      │  
│    Why it matters:                   │  
│    "You honored cultural values      │  
│     while supporting individual      │  
│     growth."                         │

#### **Stage 3: Abstract Conceptualization (Framework Insights)**

**What happens:** Student understands the "why" behind their experience. This is the "understanding" stage \- students connect their experience to broader concepts and research.

**Research Support:** Kolb (1984) found that abstract conceptualization helps students understand the principles behind their experience, making learning transferable to new situations.

### **How Scenarios Mirror Real-World Skills and Experiences**

Scenarios are designed to **elicit authentic skill demonstrations** that mirror real-world situations. Research shows that skills practiced in realistic contexts transfer better to real life (Lave & Wenger, 1991).

#### **1\. Authentic Context**

**Research Foundation:** Lave & Wenger (1991) found that learning transfers best when the practice context matches the application context. Scenarios mirror real situations students face.

**Specific Examples with Real-World Parallels:**

EXAMPLE 1: Family Pressure  
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────  
Real-World Situation:              Scenario Situation:  
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────  
Student's friend:                  Maya says:  
"I'm torn. My parents want me      "My parents worked three jobs  
to be a doctor, but I want to      each. Their dream: 'Our daughter,  
study art. They sacrificed so      the doctor.' How can I  
much for me."                      disappoint them?"

Student's Real Skills Needed:      Student's Scenario Skills:  
• Listen with empathy              • Listen with empathy  
• Understand cultural context      • Understand cultural context  
• Help reframe perspective         • Help reframe perspective  
• Support without judgment         • Support without judgment

Transfer: Same skills, same        Transfer: Skills practiced  
context, safe to practice          in scenario transfer to  
                                   real friend situation  
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

EXAMPLE 2: Career Uncertainty  
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────  
Real-World Situation:              Scenario Situation:  
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────  
Student thinks:                   Jordan says:  
"I don't know what I want to       "I don't know what I want  
do. Everyone else seems to        to do. Everyone seems to  
have a plan."                      have a plan."

Student's Real Skills Needed:      Student's Scenario Skills:  
• Explore options                  • Explore options  
• Ask questions                    • Ask questions  
• Reflect on interests             • Reflect on interests  
• Consider multiple paths         • Consider multiple paths

Transfer: Same exploration         Transfer: Exploration skills  
skills work in both contexts       practiced with Jordan help  
                                   student explore own path  
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

EXAMPLE 3: Building Trust  
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────  
Real-World Situation:              Scenario Situation:  
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────  
Student wants to build trust       Student wants to build trust  
with counselor/mentor:             with Maya:

Real Process:                     Scenario Process:  
1\. Show genuine interest           1\. Show genuine interest  
2\. Listen actively                2\. Listen actively  
3\. Respond thoughtfully           3\. Respond thoughtfully  
4\. Be consistent                  4\. Be consistent  
5\. Trust builds over time         5\. Trust builds (tracked)

Transfer: Same relationship       Transfer: Trust-building skills  
building skills work in both       practiced with Maya help  
contexts                          student build trust with  
                                   real mentors  
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

**Real-World Connection:**

Scenario Situation          Real-World Equivalent  
─────────────────────────────────────────────────  
Maya's family pressure  →   Student's own family  
                            expectations

Devon's grief processing →  Student helping friend  
                            through loss

Jordan's career confusion → Student unsure about  
                            future path

Building trust with Maya →  Building trust with  
                            mentor/counselor

#### **2\. Transferable Skills**

**Research Foundation:** Bransford, Brown, & Cocking (2000) found that skills transfer when: (1) skills are the same, (2) context is similar, and (3) students understand when to apply them.

**How it works \- Specific Process:**

SKILL TRANSFER PROCESS:

STEP 1: Practice in Scenario  
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐  
│ Scenario: Maya Family Pressure      │  
│                                      │  
│ Student demonstrates:                │  
│ • Emotional Intelligence            │  
│   (recognizing Maya's emotional      │  
│    struggle)                         │  
│                                      │  
│ • Cultural Competence                │  
│   (understanding immigrant family   │  
│    dynamics)                         │  
│                                      │  
│ • Communication                      │  
│   (reframing situation helpfully)   │  
│                                      │  
│ Context: Helping someone navigate  │  
│          family pressure            │  
└──────────────┬──────────────────────┘  
               │  
               │ Same skills  
               │ Similar context  
               ▼  
STEP 2: Recognize Similar Situation  
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐  
│ Real World: Friend shares family    │  
│             pressure                 │  
│                                      │  
│ Student thinks:                      │  
│ "This is like when I helped Maya"   │  
│                                      │  
│ Student recognizes:                  │  
│ • Same emotional struggle           │  
│ • Similar cultural dynamics         │  
│ • Same need for support             │  
└──────────────┬──────────────────────┘  
               │  
               │ Apply same skills  
               ▼  
STEP 3: Apply Skills  
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐  
│ Student helps friend:                │  
│                                      │  
│ • Uses Emotional Intelligence       │  
│   (recognizes friend's struggle)    │  
│                                      │  
│ • Uses Cultural Competence          │  
│   (understands family dynamics)     │  
│                                      │  
│ • Uses Communication                │  
│   (reframes situation helpfully)    │  
│                                      │  
│ Result: Skills transfer successfully│  
└─────────────────────────────────────┘

**Why This Works:**

* **Same skills:** Emotional Intelligence, Cultural Competence, Communication work the same way in both contexts  
* **Similar context:** Both involve helping someone navigate family pressure  
* **Safe practice:** Student can try different approaches in scenario without real-world consequences  
* **Explicit transfer:** Action Plan Builder helps student recognize when to apply skills

**Transfer Process:**

Scenario Practice:  
"I helped Maya by reframing her situation"  
    │  
    │ (Same skill: Emotional Intelligence)  
    │ (Same context: Helping someone navigate difficulty)  
    │  
    ▼  
Real-World Application:  
"I helped my friend by reframing their situation"  
    │  
    │ (Skill transfers because context is similar)  
    │  
    ▼  
Student recognizes: "I did this before in the game"

#### **3\. Evidence-Based Skill Mapping**

**Research Foundation:** Messick (1995) found that authentic assessment requires evidence of skill demonstration in realistic contexts, not just knowledge of skills.

**How it works \- Specific Example:**

EVIDENCE-BASED SKILL CAPTURE:

Scenario: Maya Family Pressure  
Choice: "Their sacrifice was an investment in your happiness, not an obligation"

┌─────────────────────────────────────┐  
│ EVIDENCE CAPTURED:                   │  
│                                      │  
│ Skill: Emotional Intelligence       │  
│ Intensity: High                     │  
│                                      │  
│ Context:                            │  
│ "Reframed parental sacrifice from   │  
│  'obligation to fulfill their       │  
│  vision' to 'investment in          │  
│  student's happiness and authentic  │  
│  success.'"                          │  
│                                      │  
│ Evidence:                           │  
│ • Recognized emotional complexity   │  
│ • Identified underlying intention    │  
│ • Reframed perspective helpfully    │  
│ • Validated competing needs         │  
│                                      │  
│ Real-World Equivalent:               │  
│ Student helping friend reframe      │  
│ similar family situation            │  
│                                      │  
│ Assessment Value:                    │  
│ Counselor can see:                   │  
│ "Student demonstrated high          │  
│  emotional intelligence by          │  
│  reframing Maya's situation. This   │  
│  shows ability to help others       │  
│  navigate complex emotions."         │  
└─────────────────────────────────────┘

**Why This Matters:**

* **Authentic evidence:** Shows actual skill demonstration, not just knowledge  
* **Rich context:** Explains exactly how skill was demonstrated  
* **Intensity rating:** Shows depth of skill demonstration (High/Medium/Low)  
* **Transferable:** Evidence shows student can use skill in real situations

**Example Evidence:**

Scenario: Maya Family Pressure  
Choice: "Their sacrifice was an investment..."

Evidence Captured:  
"Reframed parental sacrifice from 'obligation to fulfill   
their vision' to 'investment in student's happiness and   
authentic success.' Demonstrated cultural competence by   
honoring immigrant family dynamics while validating   
competing need for personal identity."

Skills: Emotional Intelligence (High)  
         Cultural Competence (High)  
         Communication (Medium)

Real-World Equivalent:  
Student helping friend navigate similar family situation  
→ Same skills, same approach, transferable evidence

#### **4\. Pattern Recognition**

**Principle:** Consistent patterns reveal authentic behavioral tendencies.

**How it works:**

* Students make choices consistently (helping, analytical, building, etc.)  
* Patterns emerge naturally from authentic choices  
* Patterns connect to real-world career preferences (RIASEC theory)  
* Patterns inform personalization and career guidance

**Pattern → Real-World Connection:**

Scenario Pattern          Real-World Indicator  
──────────────────────────────────────────────  
Helping (45% of choices) → Social career type  
                          → Healthcare, education,  
                            counseling fit

Analytical (30% of choices) → Investigative type  
                            → Science, research,  
                              engineering fit

Building (15% of choices) → Realistic type  
                           → Construction, trades,  
                             engineering fit

#### **5\. Relationship Dynamics**

**Principle:** Trust and relationship building mirror real-world social skills.

**How it works:**

* Trust gates require authentic relationship building  
* Students learn: "I need to listen and respond thoughtfully"  
* Characters respond authentically to student choices  
* Relationship progression mirrors real-world social development

**Real-World Parallel:**

Scenario Relationship      Real-World Equivalent  
─────────────────────────────────────────────────  
Stranger → Acquaintance → Building rapport with  
                          new people

Acquaintance → Friend →    Deepening friendships  
                          and connections

Friend → Confidant →       Trusted relationships  
                          with mentors/counselors

Trust Gates →              Moments where relationship  
                          deepens (vulnerability,  
                          shared experiences)

---

### **Why This Approach Works: The Research Base**

#### **1\. Authentic Assessment**

**Research:** Students demonstrate skills more authentically in realistic contexts than in tests.

**How scenarios apply:**

* Choices feel real, not like assessments  
* Students focus on helping characters, not "showing skills"  
* Skills emerge naturally from authentic responses  
* Evidence is contextual and meaningful

#### **2\. Safe Practice Space**

**Research:** Students learn better when they can practice without real-world consequences.

**How scenarios apply:**

* Students can try different approaches  
* Mistakes don't have real-world impact  
* Students can replay and explore alternatives  
* Reflection happens after safe practice

#### **3\. Immediate Feedback**

**Research:** Immediate feedback enhances learning more than delayed feedback.

**How scenarios apply:**

* Character responses provide immediate feedback  
* Trust changes show impact of choices  
* Story branches show consequences  
* Experience Summary provides structured reflection

#### **4\. Metacognitive Awareness**

**Research:** Students who understand their own learning process learn better.

**How scenarios apply:**

* Experience Summary makes learning explicit  
* Framework Insights connect to research  
* Action Plan Builder encourages self-reflection  
* Pattern recognition builds self-awareness

---

### **Summary: The Complete Learning Design**

SCENARIO DESIGN PRINCIPLES:

1\. Implicit Learning  
   └─→ Skills demonstrated naturally through authentic choices

2\. Explicit Learning

4\. Kolb's Learning Cycle  
   └─→ Experience → Reflect → Conceptualize → Experiment

5\. Real-World Connection  
   └─→ Authentic contexts, transferable skills, evidence-based mapping

RESULT:  
Students develop real skills through authentic practice,  
understand what they learned through reflection,  
and apply it to real life through action planning.
