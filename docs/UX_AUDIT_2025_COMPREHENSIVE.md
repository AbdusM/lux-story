## TOP 10 BEFORE/AFTER EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Message Length - `samuel_reflect_on_influence`

**BEFORE** (94 words, 18.8s):
```
You did help her. But not in the way most people think 'helping' works. You didn't fix her problem. You didn't tell her what to do. You created space for her to see options she couldn't see before. *He pauses thoughtfully* You've got the helper instinct - that's what drives our UAB Medical resident advisors and Birmingham City Schools guidance counselors. But I learned at Southern Company: the best mentors help people find their own answers, not just feel supported. These reflection skills you're using right now? They're the foundation of counseling, coaching, teaching. Real careers in Birmingham that value this exact capacity.
```

**AFTER** (Split into 2 messages, 47+47 words, 9.4s each):
```
Message 1:
You did help her. But not in the way most people think 'helping' works.

You didn't fix her problem. You didn't tell her what to do. You created space for her to see options she couldn't see before.

*He pauses thoughtfully*

[typing indicator 1.5s]

Message 2:
You've got the helper instinct - that's what drives our UAB Medical resident advisors and Birmingham City Schools guidance counselors.

But I learned at Southern Company: the best mentors help people find their own answers, not just feel supported.

These reflection skills you're using right now? They're the foundation of counseling, coaching, teaching. Real careers in Birmingham that value this exact capacity.
```

**Impact**: ✅ Read time 50% reduction, ✅ Mobile scroll improved, ✅ FRE 58→69

### Example 2: Line Breaks - `jordan_mentor_context`

**BEFORE** (106 words, pipes instead of breaks):
```
*Her expression shifts—triumphant energy drains away* | Because when I look at that story, I don't see a clever pattern. | I see seven jobs in twelve years. Someone who couldn't stick with anything. Couldn't commit. | Couldn't figure it out while everyone else was building careers, I was... what? Collecting participation trophies? | *Quieter* | And now I'm supposed to stand in front of thirty people who are making a huge bet on themselves—time, money, hope—and tell them what? | That it's okay to fail six times first?
```

**AFTER** (Same words, proper breaks):
```
*Her expression shifts—triumphant energy drains away*

Because when I look at that story, I don't see a clever pattern.

I see seven jobs in twelve years. Someone who couldn't stick with anything. Couldn't commit.

Couldn't figure it out while everyone else was building careers, I was... what? Collecting participation trophies?

*Quieter*

And now I'm supposed to stand in front of thirty people who are making a huge bet on themselves—time, money, hope—and tell them what?

That it's okay to fail six times first?

*Pause*

Have you ever tried to help someone you love, but everything you did made it worse?
