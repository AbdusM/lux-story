## Usage Examples

### Accessing Skill Metadata

```typescript
import { SKILL_DEFINITIONS } from '@/lib/skill-definitions'

const skill = SKILL_DEFINITIONS['criticalThinking']

console.log(skill.title)          // "Critical Thinking"
console.log(skill.superpowerName) // "Piercing Insight"
console.log(skill.manifesto)      // "You do not accept surface-level..."
```

### Displaying Skills by Cluster

```typescript
import { SKILL_DEFINITIONS } from '@/lib/skill-definitions'

const mindCluster = Object.values(SKILL_DEFINITIONS).filter(skill =>
  ['criticalThinking', 'problemSolving', 'systemsThinking', 'digitalLiteracy',
   'technicalLiteracy', 'informationLiteracy', 'strategicThinking'].includes(skill.id)
)

mindCluster.forEach(skill => {
  console.log(`${skill.superpowerName}: ${skill.definition}`)
})
```

### Getting Character Skills

```typescript
import { SKILL_CHARACTER_HINTS } from '@/lib/skill-definitions'

// Find all skills for a character
function getCharacterSkills(characterName: string): string[] {
  return Object.entries(SKILL_CHARACTER_HINTS)
    .filter(([_, chars]) => chars.includes(characterName))
    .map(([skillId]) => skillId)
}

const rohanSkills = getCharacterSkills('Rohan')
// Returns: ['criticalThinking', 'problemSolving', 'systemsThinking', 'digitalLiteracy',
//           'technicalLiteracy', 'learningAgility', 'humility', 'pragmatism', 'deepWork',
//           'informationLiteracy', 'curiosity']
```

### Pattern Skill Lookup

```typescript
import { PATTERN_METADATA } from '@/lib/patterns'
import { SKILL_DEFINITIONS } from '@/lib/skill-definitions'

function getPatternSkillDetails(pattern: PatternType) {
  const skillIds = PATTERN_METADATA[pattern].skills
  return skillIds.map(id => ({
    id,
    title: SKILL_DEFINITIONS[id].title,
    superpower: SKILL_DEFINITIONS[id].superpowerName
  }))
}

const analyticalSkills = getPatternSkillDetails('analytical')

## Design Notes

### WEF 2030 Skills Framework

All skills align with the World Economic Forum's "Future of Jobs 2030" report, emphasizing:
- **Analytical thinking** (MIND cluster)
- **Creative problem-solving** (VOICE, HANDS clusters)
- **Emotional intelligence** (HEART cluster)
- **Adaptability and resilience** (COMPASS cluster)
- **AI and tech fluency** (Future of Work skills)

### Cluster Philosophy

**MIND:** Logic and analysis—how you think
**HEART:** Relationships and empathy—how you connect
**VOICE:** Communication and creativity—how you express
**HANDS:** Execution and action—how you do
**COMPASS:** Ethics and values—why you choose
**CRAFT:** Mastery and focus—how you refine
**CENTER HUB:** Communication as the connective tissue

### Skill Balance

**Total distribution:**
- Traditional skills (non-AI): 39
- Future of Work (AI-era): 15
- Pattern-mapped skills: 19 (35% of total)
- Character-hinted skills: 30 (56% of total)

### Manifesto Philosophy

Every skill has a "manifesto"—a declaration of identity. This serves multiple purposes:
1. **Emotional resonance** - Skills feel personal, not academic
2. **Career translation** - Bridges game actions to professional competencies
3. **Identity formation** - "You are someone who..." rather than "You can..."

### Future Considerations

**Skill Unlocks:**
- Currently all skills are trackable from start
- Potential for skill-gated content or achievements
- Skill level thresholds (Novice → Practitioner → Expert)

**Character Depth:**
- 30/54 skills have character associations
- 24 skills lack character development paths
- Opportunity to deepen secondary character arcs

**Pattern Coverage:**
- 19/54 skills directly mapped to patterns
- 35 skills emerge from general gameplay
- Consider pattern-agnostic skill progression
