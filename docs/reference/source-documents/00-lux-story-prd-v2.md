# **Executive Summary**

## **Product Vision**

LUX Story is a narrative-driven career exploration game that functions as a "Trojan Horse" for workforce development. It looks, feels, and plays like a premium indie game (inspired by Disco Elysium and Mass Effect), but every interaction invisibly tracks Future Skills defined by the World Economic Forum's 2030 framework.

**Core Philosophy:** "Career discovery through contemplation, not examination."

The game follows a worldbuilding-first development approach where deep lore work becomes the specification document that informs all subsequent production. Every design decision—from art direction to quest structure—flows from the foundational worldbuilding of Grand Central Terminus, the mysterious train station that appears between who you were and who you're becoming.

## **Strategic Objectives**

1. Deliver a compelling narrative experience that players genuinely want to engage with, not a thinly-veiled assessment tool

2. Track 50+ granular skills through natural dialogue choices that reveal behavioral patterns without explicit testing

3. Map player patterns to Birmingham-Ready Career Paths in sustainable construction, healthcare tech, cybersecurity, advanced logistics, fintech, and community data

4. Provide educators and workforce development partners with actionable insights through a comprehensive admin dashboard

5. Achieve mobile-first deployment with 5-7 minute session optimization for youth audiences (ages 14-24)

## **Key Differentiators**

* Pattern-Based Assessment: Five behavioral patterns (Analytical, Patience, Exploring, Helping, Building) tracked through 16,000+ lines of dialogue

* The "Heart & Hands" Engine: Graph-based narrative (Heart) combined with real-world job simulations (Hands) embedded directly into story

* Trust Economy: Trading information (KnowledgeFlags) as the primary currency—relationships unlock content, not coins

* Psychological Depth: Pattern Voices speak as inner monologue; NPCs dynamically mirror player identity formation

* Worldbuilding-First Architecture: Content organized into "Fractals"—self-contained sectors expandable infinitely

# **Product Overview**

## **Problem Statement**

Traditional career assessments fail youth for three interconnected reasons:

* Examination Anxiety: Multiple-choice tests feel like judgment, triggering defensive responses rather than authentic self-expression

* Abstract Disconnection: Results like "INTJ" or "79% analytical" provide labels without lived understanding of what careers actually feel like

* Engagement Failure: Career exploration tools compete with TikTok, games, and social media for attention—and consistently lose

The Birmingham Catalyze Challenge identified a critical need: workforce development tools that meet youth where they are, in formats they actually want to engage with.

## **Solution Approach**

LUX Story inverts the assessment paradigm. Instead of asking "What career fits you?" it creates situations where players naturally demonstrate who they are through choices. The magic happens through three mechanisms:

**Narrative Immersion:** Players make choices because they're engaged in a story, not because they're being evaluated. A conversation with Maya about family pressure reveals more about conflict resolution style than any survey.

**Pattern Revelation:** The five behavioral patterns emerge organically. A player who consistently asks "why" before acting demonstrates Analytical tendencies; one who says "let me help" demonstrates Helping orientation. These aren't right or wrong—they're identity.

**Career Translation:** Behind the scenes, patterns map to WEF 2030 skills which map to Birmingham career paths. The player explores platforms in a train station; the system builds a career profile.

## **Target Audience**

| Segment | Characteristics | Engagement Goal |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Primary: Birmingham Youth | Ages 14-24, mobile-first, limited career exposure | Complete at least one character arc (45-60 min total) |
| Secondary: Educators | Teachers, counselors, workforce coaches | Deploy to cohorts, analyze patterns, inform guidance |
| Tertiary: Parents/Guardians | Seeking insight into child's strengths | Receive "family-friendly" dashboard summaries |

# **Worldbuilding Foundation**

Following the worldbuilding-first development methodology, LUX Story's narrative infrastructure was built before any production work began. This section serves as the canonical IP Bible.

## **Core Setting: Grand Central Terminus**

Grand Central Terminus is not a place—it's a threshold. The station appears between who you were and who you're becoming, a liminal space where the tracks of possible futures converge. No one arrives by accident; the station finds you when you're ready to ask the questions you've been avoiding.

### **Cosmology**

* The station exists outside linear time—platforms connect to moments of decision rather than destinations

* Each character represents a different answer to the question "What matters most?"

* The architecture responds to the traveler—spaces expand for exploration, contract for focus

* Trains arrive and depart on schedules that only make sense in retrospect

### **Magical Realism Framework**

LUX Story operates in magical realism territory: the supernatural is present but never explained. The station's impossibility is accepted rather than questioned. This allows career exploration themes to be addressed through metaphor without breaking immersion.

* Technology and magic coexist without contradiction

* Characters acknowledge strangeness but don't dwell on it

* The player's choices have weight because consequences feel real, even in an unreal space

## **Station Geography (Sector System)**

Content is organized into "Fractals"—self-contained sectors that can be expanded infinitely without breaking the core narrative:

| Sector | Theme | Gameplay Focus |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Sector 0: Station Entry | Discovery, arrival, disorientation | Tutorial, pattern baseline, Samuel introduction |
| Sector 1: Grand Hall | Reality Switching, perspective shifts | Character introductions, trust building |
| Sector 2: Market | Trust Economy, information trading | KnowledgeFlags, relationship deepening |
| Sector 3: Deep Station | Recursion, reflection | New Game+, pattern mastery |

## **Character Roster**

Eleven characters inhabit Grand Central Terminus, each representing different career paths and philosophical approaches to life's fundamental questions:

| Character | Animal | Career Domain | Core Tension |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Samuel | Owl | Station Keeper (Hub) | Wisdom vs. intervention—when to guide, when to let discover |
| Maya | Cat | Tech Innovation | Family expectations vs. personal passion |
| Devon | Deer | Systems Engineering | Big picture thinking vs. detail obsession |
| Jordan | — | Career Navigation | Helping others find paths vs. finding their own |
| Marcus | Bear | Healthcare Tech | Scientific objectivity vs. human compassion |
| Tess | Fox | Education/Founding | Institution-building vs. individual impact |
| Yaquin | Rabbit | EdTech Creation | Scale vs. depth in learning |
| Kai | — | Safety/Security | Protection vs. freedom |
| Rohan | Raven | Deep Tech/Research | Knowledge pursuit vs. practical application |
| Alex | — | Generalist | Breadth vs. specialization |
| Silas | — | Crisis Management | Quick action vs. careful analysis |

## **Design Pillars**

These five pillars serve as decision-making filters throughout production:

1. Feel Comes First: The game must feel good within the first 30 seconds. Controls intuitive, actions satisfying, friction is design failure.

2. Respect Player Intelligence: Don't overexplain. Let players discover. Failure teaches, not punishes.

3. Meaningful Choices: Every decision has visible consequences. No obvious "right" answers—only trade-offs that reflect player identity.

4. Emotion Over Mechanics: What players feel matters more than what they do. Mechanics serve emotional experience.

5. Show, Don't Tell: World communicates narrative. Reduce text/tutorials through visual design and environmental storytelling.

# **Game Mechanics**

## **Core Loop**

The fundamental gameplay loop follows a Dialogue → Choice → Consequence → Revelation cycle:

1. Dialogue: NPCs present situations, share perspectives, ask questions through character-voiced text

2. Choice: Player selects from 2-4 options, each expressing different behavioral patterns

3. Consequence: Game state updates—trust changes, knowledge flags set, patterns increment

4. Revelation: Subtle feedback through pattern sensations, relationship shifts, and unlocked content

Sessions are optimized for 5-7 minute engagement windows, with clear save points and context restoration.

## **Pattern System (The Brain)**

Five behavioral patterns are tracked through choice analysis. These represent decision-making approaches, not personality types:

| Pattern | Description | Archetype |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Analytical | "You see the hidden threads where others see only chaos. The truth is a tapestry waiting to be untangled." | The Weaver |
| Patience | "You are the stillness in the storm. When the world rushes, you hold fast, allowing the moment to speak." | The Anchor |
| Exploring | "The map is not the territory. You step off the path because the unknown is where the answers live." | The Voyager |
| Helping | "You feel the resonance between people. You tune the discord until it becomes a chord." | The Harmonic |
| Building | "You do not wait for the future; you forge it. Your hands turn abstract hope into concrete reality." | The Architect |

### **Pattern Thresholds**

* EMERGING (3+): Pattern voice whispers, basic dialogue options unlock

* DEVELOPING (6+): Pattern voice urges, standard options and character-specific content unlock

* FLOURISHING (9+): Pattern voice commands, mastery options and advanced simulations unlock

### **Pattern Sensations**

When players lean into a pattern, they receive subtle atmospheric feedback—the station notices:

* Analytical: "You pause to consider the angles." / "The pattern emerges."

* Patience: "You let the moment breathe." / "Silence has its own answers."

* Exploring: "Curiosity pulls at you." / "The unknown beckons."

* Helping: "Something in you reaches out." / "Connection matters. You know this."

* Building: "Your hands itch to make it real." / "You see what could be."

## **Trust System**

Trust is the primary currency in Grand Central Terminus. Unlike traditional RPG reputation systems, trust is bilateral—you can trust characters, and they can trust you.

* Trust Range: 0 (Stranger) to 10 (Confidant)

* Trust Labels: Stranger → Acquaintance → Known → Trusted → Confidant

* Trust \= Discovery: High trust unlocks entire conversation branches, not just individual choices

* Trust Decay: Extended absence reduces trust, requiring re-engagement

## **Dialogue System**

### **Graph-Based Navigation**

Dialogue is structured as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) using the DialogueGraphNavigator. Each node contains:

* speakerId: Which character is speaking

* text: Dialogue content with rich text markup support

* choices: Array of player options with conditions and consequences

* stateChanges: Pattern increments, trust modifications, flag sets

* transitions: Next node(s) based on conditions

### **Choice Architecture**

Following the Accept/Reject/Deflect pattern from Inkle's design framework:

* Accept: Follow the current topic cooperatively

* Reject: Go on the attack confrontationally

* Deflect: Escape or change subject

All choices must pass the "two reasonable people" test: would two different players make different choices? If everyone chooses the same option, it's a fake choice.

### **Character Typing**

Each character has distinct typing speeds and patterns that reflect their personality:

* Samuel (Owl): Slow, measured—deliberate pauses suggest wisdom

* Maya (Cat): Fast, bursty—energy and impatience

* Devon (Deer): Steady, methodical—systematic thinking

# **UX/UI Specifications**

## **Design System: Sentient Glass**

The visual language follows a "Glass Morphic" aesthetic—surfaces that suggest depth and transparency while maintaining readability:

* Glass panels: rgba backgrounds with backdrop blur, subtle borders

* Pattern glows: Colored accents based on dominant patterns

* Breathing animations: Gentle pulsing for dormant elements

* Marquee shimmer: Two-layer forward/reverse animation for attention

## **Layout Architecture**

Fixed three-zone layout following Claude/ChatGPT patterns:

* HEADER (flex-shrink-0): Navigation, never moves

* MAIN (flex-1, overflow-y-auto): Dialogue container, scrollable content

* FOOTER (flex-shrink-0): Choice interface, never moves

## **Visual Hierarchy**

| Element | Style | Purpose |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| NPC Dialogue | Standard glass-panel, rgba(10,12,16,0.85) | Primary content delivery |
| Narrative Text | Larger font, marquee shimmer, different hue | Environmental/atmospheric description |
| Player Choices | Button with pattern-color hover glow | Primary interaction point |
| Pattern Sensation | Italicized, subtle fade-in | Internal monologue feedback |

## **Animation Standards**

| Use Case | Spring Config | Duration |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Micro-interactions (buttons) | springs.snappy | \~150ms |
| Panels, modals | springs.smooth | \~300ms |
| Fades, reveals | springs.gentle | \~250ms |
| Stagger delay | STAGGER\_DELAY.normal | 80ms between items |

## **Mobile-First Constraints**

* Safe area padding for notched devices: env(safe-area-inset-\*)

* Viewport meta preventing zoom on iOS

* \-webkit-tap-highlight-color: transparent for clean touch

* Touch targets: 44px minimum (Apple HIG compliance)

| Content creation bottleneck | High | AI-assisted dialogue generation with human review; modular content templates |
| Privacy concerns (youth data) | Medium | COPPA compliance; minimal PII collection; parent/guardian consent flows |
| Platform dependency (Vercel/Supabase) | Low | Standard technologies with migration paths; offline-first architecture |

## **Lessons from Industry Failures**

Per the worldbuilding-first methodology, we've studied documented failures to avoid their patterns:

### **Destiny's Grimoire Problem**

Bungie built extensive lore but stored it on external websites. Players earned content they couldn't access in-game.

**Our mitigation:** All worldbuilding is surfaced through gameplay. No external wikis required for comprehension.

### **Anthem's Directionless Development**

BioWare spent 6+ years without clear vision, relying on "magic" to solve problems during crunch.

**Our mitigation:** Design pillars established before production. Every feature evaluated against pillars. Scope locked early.

### **Project Blackbird's Margin Murder**

Microsoft cancelled a game executives loved because it didn't meet 30% profit margin targets.

**Our mitigation:** B2B workforce development revenue model. Educational partnerships provide sustainable funding. Not dependent on consumer game economics.
