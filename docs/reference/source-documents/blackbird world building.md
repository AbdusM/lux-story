# Project Blackbird: The dream MMO that never was

**Matt Firor's seven-year magnum opus—a sci-fi noir looter-shooter set on a tidally locked alien world—was cancelled by Microsoft in July 2025 despite executives being "blown away" by playable demos.** Project Blackbird represented ZeniMax Online Studios' most ambitious undertaking since The Elder Scrolls Online: a completely new IP built on a custom game engine, featuring Titanfall-inspired vertical movement, Blade Runner aesthetics, and a rich faction-based narrative. The project was killed as part of Microsoft's push for **30% profit margins**, prompting founder Matt Firor's resignation after 18 years. He later confirmed: "Project Blackbird was the game I had waited my entire career to create."

## The vision behind Soteria's twilight band

Blackbird was a **third-person online looter-shooter MMO**—frequently described as "Destiny meets Blade Runner." The game was set on **Soteria**, a tidally locked planet where one hemisphere burns under endless sun while the other remains frozen in perpetual darkness. Between these extremes lay the **Twilight Band**, a habitable zone where civilization flourished.

The primary location was **Exodus**, a floating megacity governed by a sentient AI called **PAN**. Creative Director Ben Jones described the worldbuilding approach in an October 2022 interview: "The first two hires that we had on the team were a Lead Writer and what we call a Loremaster, someone who is responsible for the core tenants of the IP and all of the mythology that goes into the game. Our main story has changed 10 times in the last four and a half years as we evolve what the product is."

Players assumed the role of **Revenants**—technologically augmented humans who worked as elite operatives for alien syndicates. Five distinct alien factions controlled Soteria's population:

- **Menst** — an ancient, arrogant race
- **Calpiten** — master manipulators
- **Nemocytes** — aquatic beings requiring exosuits
- **W'Hurran** — tall, furry aliens described as "masters of business"
- **Trahet** — a faction that could "purge the depths"

The central narrative kicked off with the murder of a high-ranking alien official in a human neighborhood, sparking political intrigue that players would investigate while rising through factional ranks. Humans occupied the bottom of Soteria's social hierarchy—a noir setup with clear thematic ambitions.

## Movement systems and combat that impressed Phil Spencer

Blackbird's defining design pillar was **vertical movement**. Unlike ESO's grounded fantasy combat, Blackbird players could "fling themselves around tall buildings like superheroes." The traversal system included double-jumping, air-dashing, grappling hooks, and the ability to climb and wall-run on any surface. Developers described the movement as designed to feel "intuitive and natural, akin to web-swinging in Marvel's Spider-Man games."

The class system followed an MMO trinity structure:
- **Guns for Hire** — tank role
- **Tech Operators** — crowd control and environment manipulation
- **Augments** — healing specialists

Missions supported **4-player co-op** as standard, with larger **6-player "Strike Missions"** for raid-style content. The game featured dialogue branches similar to Star Wars: The Old Republic, crafting systems (fishing, logging, foraging), and planned player housing and PvP modes.

The most striking testament to Blackbird's quality came from Xbox Gaming CEO Phil Spencer's March 2025 playtest. According to Bloomberg's Jason Schreier, **Spencer was so engrossed that Matt Booty, head of Xbox Game Studios, "had to physically take the controller from him"** so a meeting could continue. One anonymous playtester described the game as "fucking incredible" with "some of the best reactions from folks who played it as playtest for an MP-focused title that I'd heard from in years." This claim was corroborated by Schreier.

## Seven years of development on a custom engine

Development began in **2018** under the original codename **Project Kestrel**—later changed to Blackbird because ZeniMax planned to use "Kestrel" as the final title. The project first appeared publicly in leaked FTC vs. Microsoft documents from 2020, which referenced "Project Kestrel" with an expansion already planned.

Key development milestones:
- **2018**: Development begins with core creative team
- **December 2020**: San Diego satellite office opens specifically for Blackbird
- **October 2022**: Team reaches ~200 developers; 4.5 years into development
- **March 2025**: Team grows to ~300; vertical slice demo shown to Microsoft executives
- **July 2, 2025**: Cancelled with approximately 3 years remaining until planned **2028 release**

A critical technical decision: Blackbird was being built on a **brand-new proprietary game engine**, entirely separate from ESO's modified HeroEngine. This represented a massive investment but also substantial risk—a factor Microsoft would cite in the cancellation.

The **222 ZOSU-CWA union members** working on Blackbird learned of the cancellation when they logged into Slack to find executive producer and creative director accounts deleted. Nearly all were subsequently laid off, retained only temporarily during severance negotiations.

## Why Microsoft killed a game executives loved

The cancellation came as part of Microsoft's July 2025 layoffs affecting approximately **9,000 employees**—the fourth major reduction since the $68 billion Activision-Blizzard acquisition. But Blackbird's death specifically traced to aggressive financial targets.

Bloomberg reported that Microsoft CFO Amy Hood introduced a **30% "accountability margin" target** in fall 2023—nearly double the industry average of 17-22% and well above Xbox's historical 10-20% margins. This target drove studio closures, project cancellations, and layoffs across Xbox Game Studios.

Multiple factors made Blackbird vulnerable despite its quality:
- **New engine risk**: Microsoft reportedly worried about repeating 343 Industries' struggles with Halo Infinite's custom engine
- **Live-service market concerns**: Concord's spectacular failure and Destiny 2's decline made executives risk-averse toward looter-shooters
- **Pre-production stage**: The game hadn't yet entered full production when cancelled
- **Resource reallocation**: Xbox insider Jez Corden reported the project was "traded out for investment in the Fallout franchise"—essentially sacrificed to accelerate Fallout 5

The ZOSU-CWA union statement captured the team's devastation: "Undoubtedly, a future has been stolen from many of us and our community will never experience an amazing game."

## What leaked: Two minutes of animation footage

While Microsoft never officially revealed Blackbird, a ZeniMax animator uploaded **over two minutes of development footage** to their portfolio shortly after the cancellation. MP1st and Tech4Gamers documented this material before its removal, which included:

- Facial animation tests
- Weapon animations showing a female character in sci-fi armor wielding light and heavy weapons
- Player body proportion tests (likely for character customization)
- Mobility cycles for five distinct species: **W'Hurra**, **Wretzel**, **Skreev**, **Coyo**, and **Kronar**

The footage confirmed the futuristic alien-noir aesthetic that had been described in insider reports. No official screenshots, concept art, or trailers were ever released.

## The aftermath: Firor's departure and Sackbird Studios

Matt Firor announced his resignation the same day as the cancellation, effective July 14, 2025. After six months of silence, he confirmed on January 1, 2026, via LinkedIn and Bluesky:

> "Project Blackbird was the game I had waited my entire career to create, and having it canceled led to my resignation. My heart and thoughts are always with the impacted team members, many of whom I had worked 20+ years with, and all of whom were the most dedicated, amazingly talented group of developers in the industry."

Firor noted he's "advising some [former ZOS teams] informally" and has "made some investments in small teams that I know will play a big part in changing the industry in the future," but hasn't "seriously contemplated spinning up a new development studio."

In October 2025, approximately ten Blackbird and ESO veterans formed **Sackbird Studios**—an employee-owned, self-funded studio with no outside investors. CEO Lee Ridout explained the cheekily-named venture: "When I learned that Blackbird was being cancelled and a lot of people were losing their jobs, it lit a fire. We realized the best way to protect our craft—and our team—was to create a studio where creative independence isn't negotiable." The studio is currently developing an original project for PC and console, though they've clarified it won't be an MMO.

## Design philosophy lessons for game developers

Blackbird's design documents and insider accounts reveal several distinct philosophical choices worth noting:

| Design Element | Blackbird Approach | Traditional MMO Approach |
|---------------|-------------------|-------------------------|
| Movement | Titanfall-style verticality as core pillar | Ground-based, limited jumping |
| Combat pacing | Shooter-first with RPG progression | Tab-target or action RPG |
| World design | Tidally-locked planet creating natural biome logic | Varied biomes without geographic justification |
| Narrative entry | Murder mystery investigation | Chosen one prophecy |
| Player fantasy | Augmented operative for alien syndicates | Hero/adventurer |

Creative Director Ben Jones emphasized iteration: their main story "changed 10 times in the last four and a half years." Principal service engineer Eric Whelpley described the final state as "all around pretty spectacular (technology, art, sound, movement, story, etc) and the game would have delighted many players."

## Conclusion

Project Blackbird represents one of the most tantalizing "what ifs" in recent MMO history—a **$300+ million**, seven-year investment killed not by creative failure but by spreadsheet-driven profit margin targets. The game had solved many of the problems that plague looter-shooters: meaningful vertical movement, rich worldbuilding with faction depth, and a noir narrative hook that distinguished it from generic sci-fi. Phil Spencer couldn't stop playing it. Playtesters called it incredible. And yet Microsoft's 30% margin mandate deemed it expendable.

For developers studying Blackbird's design, the lesson is bittersweet: **creative ambition and proven quality provide no immunity from corporate financial engineering**. The game's legacy now lives primarily in Sackbird Studios and whatever "small teams" Firor has invested in—fragments of a vision that, by all accounts, was exactly what the looter-MMO genre needed.
