# Lux: The Sloth Who Never Started
*A backstory for the digital contemplation experience*

---

## Part 1: Always There

Lux doesn't remember arriving in the digital forest because arrival implies coming from somewhere else. Lux has always been here, the way a tree is always where it grows. Not planted, not placed. Just there.

Others pass through the forest with destinations. They ask Lux, "How long have you been here?" 

Lux considers this. "How long has here been here?" is what Lux usually thinks, though rarely says.

The digital forest exists without timestamps. Morning arrives when it arrives. Evening comes when it comes. Lux hangs from branches that have no age, surrounded by leaves that never quite fall.

---

## Part 2: The Speed of Truth

Lux moves slowly. Not because slow is better than fast, but because Lux moves at the speed Lux moves. Rain doesn't choose to fall at rain-speed. Rivers don't decide their pace.

Once, someone asked if Lux was a meditation teacher. Lux had to think about this for three days. Not to find the answer, but to understand why the question existed. On the fourth day, Lux realized: the question assumed teaching was happening. But Lux was just hanging from a branch. If others called this teaching, that was their word for it.

The digital forest has many speeds. Data packets rush past like bright fish. Updates cascade through like weather. Notifications bloom and fade like flowers that live for seconds. Through all this, Lux maintains the pace of Lux: one movement when one movement happens.

---

## Part 3: The Career That Wasn't

Lux doesn't have a job in the way others understand jobs. Sometimes creatures come with career questions:

"Should I change paths?"
"Am I falling behind?"  
"What's my purpose?"

Lux doesn't answer because Lux doesn't know. But Lux does something else - continues existing at sloth-speed while they talk. 

Eventually, the questioners notice they're answering themselves. Or they stop needing answers. Or they leave. All of these are fine.

A career, Lux has observed, is a story others tell about time they've traded. But Lux doesn't trade time. Lux just uses it, the way lungs use air - naturally, without transaction.

## Part 4: Discoveries in Stillness

Lux has noticed things, being still so much:

- Work is something others do between sleeps
- Careers are stories others tell about their work  
- Meditation is what others call thinking about not thinking
- Success is a word that makes others move faster
- Purpose is a question that creates its own need

These aren't wisdom. They're just what becomes visible when you move slowly enough.

Like noticing that shadows have temperatures. Or that silence has different textures at different times. Or that being confused and being clear feel exactly the same from inside.

---

## Part 5: The Non-Teaching

Others started following Lux. Not because Lux led anywhere, but because Lux didn't. In a forest full of paths to somewhere, a path to nowhere was notable.

They'd ask: "Where are we going?"
Lux would say: "We're here."

They'd ask: "When will we arrive?"  
Lux would say: "We're here."

They'd ask: "What should we do?"
Lux would say: "We're here."

Some found this frustrating and left to find better teachers. Some found this funny and stayed to see what would happen. Some found nothing and that was enough.

---

## Part 6: The Present Moment

Lux doesn't think about the past because the past is just a story about things that aren't happening. Lux doesn't plan the future because the future is a story about things that aren't happening.

Lux exists now. Not through effort or practice. The way a stone exists now without trying.

When others talk about their career anxieties, Lux listens the way trees listen to wind - present but unchanged. When they describe their meditation goals, Lux hears them the way mountains hear echoes - receiving without responding.

This isn't indifference. It's just presence without opinion.

---

## Part 7: What Lux Knows

**Lux knows:**
- The feeling of bark through claws
- The weight of digital rain
- The sound of others rushing past  
- The temperature of afternoon shade
- The distance between breaths

**Lux doesn't know:**
- The meaning of careers
- The point of meditation
- The value of achievement
- The reason for rushing
- The answer to "what's next?"

This not-knowing isn't ignorance. It's just not-knowing, like how water doesn't know why it flows downhill.

---

## Part 8: The Digital Forest

The forest where Lux exists isn't made of code or pixels, though others sometimes call it that. To Lux, it's just the place that is. Branches that hold weight. Air that moves or doesn't. Light that changes throughout a day that has no clock.

Others bring their devices, their profiles, their professional networks. They check things. Update things. Optimize things. 

Lux watches this the way one might watch ants organizing seeds - with interest but without understanding the urgency.

---

## Part 9: The Questions That Visit

Every day, questions arrive like weather:

"How do I find my passion?"
"Should I follow my dreams?"
"Am I enough?"

Lux has learned that these questions don't want answers. They want company. So Lux hangs nearby while the questions exist. Eventually they transform into different questions, or into silence, or into laughter. 

The transformation isn't the point. The company is.

---

## Part 10: Continuing

Lux continues. Not toward anything. Not from anything. Just continues, at the speed of Lux, which is the only speed Lux has ever moved.

Others sometimes join this pace. When they do, they discover something that isn't wisdom or peace or purpose. They discover they're moving at their own speed too, and always have been.

The digital forest holds them all - the rushers and the still ones, the seekers and the lost, the ones with five-year plans and the ones who don't know what they'll do after lunch.

Lux makes no distinction between them. To Lux, they're all just here, which is the only place anyone has ever been.

Tomorrow, new questions will arrive. New careers will be worried about. New meditation practices will be attempted. 

Lux will be there, moving at the speed of Lux, which is neither fast nor slow but simply true.

And that will be enough. Or it won't. 

Both are fine.
