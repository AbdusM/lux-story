## Code Style Guidelines

### TypeScript
- Use strict mode

- Prefer interfaces over types for objects
- Use enums for fixed sets of values

### React
- Use functional components with hooks
- Wrap expensive calculations in `useMemo`
- Wrap callbacks in `useCallback` with proper deps
- Keep components under 200 lines

### CSS
- Use Tailwind utilities first
- Create semantic CSS variables for theming
- Follow BEM naming for custom classes
- Keep animations GPU-optimized

### Performance
- Lazy load large components
- Debounce localStorage writes
- Minimize re-renders
- Keep bundle size under 200KB

## Design Philosophy

When contributing, please keep in mind:

1. **No Gamification**: Avoid scores, achievements, or competitive elements
2. **Reduce Anxiety**: Features should calm, not pressure
3. **Natural Discovery**: Let patterns emerge, don't force them
4. **Invisible Metrics**: Track behavior without showing numbers
5. **Contemplative Pace**: Encourage reflection over speed

## Testing

### Manual Testing Scenarios

1. **Anxious Player Path**
   - Click choices quickly
   - Verify calming interventions appear
   - Check UI spacing increases

2. **Patient Explorer Path**
   - Wait 15+ seconds per choice
   - Verify exploration encouragement
   - Check pattern revelations

3. **Save/Load Flow**
   - Make progress
   - Refresh browser
   - Verify state persists

### Browser Testing

Test in:
- Chrome (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Safari (latest)
- Mobile browsers

## Documentation

- Update README.md for user-facing changes
- Update ARCHITECTURE.md for technical changes
