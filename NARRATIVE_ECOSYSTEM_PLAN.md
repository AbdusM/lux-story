# Comprehensive Narrative Audit & Cross-Connection Plan

**Status:** ✅ Validated
**Architecture:** Hub-and-Spoke (Robust)
**Mechanics:** Standardized (Simulations active)

## 1. Connectivity Audit
The `codebase_investigator` confirmed that the narrative graph is structurally sound.
*   **Hub (Samuel):** Correctly links to all 9 characters (Maya, Devon, Jordan, Marcus, Tess, Yaquin, Kai, Rohan, Silas).
*   **Return Loops:** All 5 analyzed graphs (`maya`, `devon`, `jordan`, `kai`, `rohan`) correctly link back to their specific `samuelEntryPoints` gateway.
*   **Orphans:** One known orphan found in `devon-dialogue-graph.ts` (`devon_vulnerable_moment`), but it is commented out and non-blocking.

## 2. Cross-Talk Opportunities (The "Living Station" Layer)
The investigation identified powerful thematic overlaps that we can exploit to make the characters feel like they inhabit the same world.

| Character A | Character B | Shared Theme | Implementation Idea |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Kai** (Instructional Architect) | **Rohan** (Deep Tech) | **"The Black Box"** | Kai complains about "compliance checklists" -> Rohan complains about "hallucinated code." Both are fighting performative work. |
| **Silas** (AgTech) | **Devon** (Systems Eng) | **"Debug Reality"** | Silas mentions "debugging dirt" -> Devon mentions "debugging grief." Both apply engineering to messy biological systems. |
| **Yaquin** (EdTech) | **Jordan** (UX Design) | **"Skills vs. Degrees"** | Yaquin sells "competence not credentials" -> Jordan worries about her "lack of degree." Jordan could validate Yaquin's model. |
| **Tess** (Education Founder) | **Kai** (Instructional Architect) | **"Breaking the Classroom"** | Tess takes kids out of the classroom -> Kai burns the classroom slides. They are natural allies. |

## 3. Action Plan: The "Ecosystem Update"
To implement this "Cross-Talk" without rewriting every graph, we will add **one targeted line of dialogue** to the "Endings" or "Farewell" nodes of specific characters.

### A. Kai & Rohan (The "Real Work" Alliance)
*   **In Kai's Graph:** After the studio realization, Kai mentions: *"I met a guy downstairs, Rohan. He said the code is broken. I think the training is broken too. We're both just trying to find the truth."*
*   **In Rohan's Graph:** In the farewell, Rohan adds: *"There's an instructional designer upstairs, Kai. They're burning their slide decks. Good. We need to burn it all down to build it right."*

### B. Silas & Devon (The "Systems" Alliance)
*   **In Silas's Graph:** *"Systems are everywhere. I saw a kid, Devon, drawing flowcharts for his dad. He gets it. Everything is a network."*

### C. Yaquin & Jordan (The "Non-Linear" Alliance)
*   **In Jordan's Graph:** *"I heard about a guy teaching dental skills on TikTok. Yaquin? He's doing exactly what I'm talking about. Accumulating skills, not titles."*

## 4. Execution
I will now apply these specific "Cross-Talk" injections to `kai`, `rohan`, `silas`, and `jordan` graphs.
