Cities, bridges, but also relationships, communities, hope.\n\nPlatform 9 (Growing): Seasons cycle in seconds here. You watch careers planted, grown, harvested, replanted. The patience required is staggering.\n\nThe Forgotten Platform: Here are the jobs nobody mentions at career day. The midnight coders who keep the internet running. The translators who prevent wars.
