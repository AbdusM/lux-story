The paper felt thick between your fingers, expensive, with a faint smell of brass polish.\n\n'Your future awaits at Platform 7. Midnight. Don't be late.'\n\nNo signature. No postmark. Just your name written in handwriting that feels familiar but impossible to place.\n\nNow you're standing at the entrance to Grand Central Terminus - a station that wasn't here yesterday. Cold November air bites at your exposed skin. The clock tower shows 11:47 PM, its mechanical tick echoing against wet concrete.\n\nThirteen minutes to find Platform 7. Thirteen minutes to meet your future.\n\nIf you believe the letter."
