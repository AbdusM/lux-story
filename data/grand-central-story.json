Cities, bridges, but also relationships, communities, hope.\n\nPlatform 9 (Growing): Seasons cycle in seconds here. You watch careers planted, grown, harvested, replanted. The patience required is staggering.\n\nThe Forgotten Platform: Here are the jobs nobody mentions at career day. The midnight coders who keep the internet running. The translators who prevent wars. The janitors like Marcus who maintain more than just cleanliness.\n\nAnd Platform 7½: It doesn't exist yet. But there's space for it, shimmering between 7 and 8, waiting for someone to define it.\n\nWhen you return to your bench, you understand: Every platform is right for someone. No platform is right for everyone."
