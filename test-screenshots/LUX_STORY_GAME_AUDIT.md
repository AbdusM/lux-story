## ðŸŽ® **GAME-FOCUSED AUDIT CONCLUSION**

**The Lux Story game has potential but faces critical user experience issues that need immediate attention. The focus should be on:**

1. **âœ… Fixing reported bugs** (avatar gender, choice buttons)
2. **âœ… Improving core game experience** (dialogue, choices, narrative)
3. **âœ… Validating educational effectiveness** (learning outcomes, engagement)
4. **âœ… Optimizing for target users** (mobile, accessibility, performance)

**The LinkDap integration was a distraction from the core game experience. The priority should be making the Lux Story game itself compelling, educational, and bug-free.**
