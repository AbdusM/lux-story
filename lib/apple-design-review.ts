Currently, the experience tries to do everything - emotional tracking, cognitive development, career exploration, skill building, and more. This creates visual clutter, interaction friction, and emotional distance.

The Apple-level solution is to strip away all the clinical support systems and focus on one thing: creating a beautiful, emotionally resonant career exploration experience that Birmingham youth will fall in love with.

Instead of tracking emotions, let the story naturally evoke them. Instead of measuring cognitive development, let the choices naturally develop thinking. Instead of explicit skill building, let the career exploration naturally build skills.

The result should feel like a beautiful, confident piece of software that happens to help with career exploration, not a career exploration tool that happens to be software.

This is the difference between a tool and a work of art. Apple makes tools that are works of art.`
