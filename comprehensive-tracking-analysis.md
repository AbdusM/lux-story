# Comprehensive User Interaction Tracking Analysis

## Current Data Flow Analysis

### 1. User Interactions Tracked
- **Choices**: `trackUserChoice()` in `useSimpleGame.ts` → `SimpleCareerAnalytics`
- **Skills**: `SkillTracker.recordChoice()` → `skill_summaries` table
- **Game State**: `GameStateManager.recordChoice()` → localStorage
- **Performance**: `PerformanceSystem.updateFromChoice()` → localStorage
- **Career Values**: `GrandCentralStateManager` → localStorage

### 2. Database Tables
- `player_profiles` - Basic user info
- `skill_summaries` - Aggregated skill demonstrations
- `career_explorations` - Career interests and matches
- `career_analytics` - Career tracking data
- `skill_demonstrations` - Individual skill events
- `relationship_progress` - Character relationships

### 3. Admin Dashboard Requirements
- **Skills Tab**: `skillDemonstrations`, `totalDemonstrations`
- **Careers Tab**: `careerMatches`, `careerExplorations`
- **Evidence Tab**: All 5 frameworks with real data
- **Gaps Tab**: `skillGaps` derived from skills vs careers
- **Action Tab**: Birmingham opportunities and next steps

## Critical Gaps Identified

### Gap 1: Career Data Not Generated from Interactions
- **Problem**: `career_explorations` table is empty
- **Root Cause**: `SimpleCareerAnalytics` tracks interests but doesn't create career explorations
- **Impact**: Career tab shows empty data

### Gap 2: Performance Data Not Synced
- **Problem**: `PerformanceSystem` data stays in localStorage
- **Root Cause**: No sync mechanism for performance metrics
- **Impact**: Evidence tab shows mock data

### Gap 3: Career Values Not Persisted
- **Problem**: `careerValues` in `GrandCentralState` not saved to database
- **Root Cause**: No database sync for career values
- **Impact**: Missing career affinity data

### Gap 4: Relationship Data Not Tracked
- **Problem**: Character relationships not persisted
- **Root Cause**: No sync for relationship progress
- **Impact**: Missing social/emotional insights

### Gap 5: Scene History Not Tracked
- **Problem**: Scene visits and time spent not recorded
- **Root Cause**: No comprehensive scene tracking
- **Impact**: Missing engagement metrics

## Required Implementation

### 1. Comprehensive Interaction Tracker
Create a unified system that captures:
- All user choices with context
- Scene visits and time spent
- Character interactions
- Skill demonstrations
- Career value changes
- Performance metrics

### 2. Database Sync Layer
Ensure all tracked data syncs to appropriate tables:
- `player_profiles` - User state and progress
- `skill_summaries` - Aggregated skill data
- `career_explorations` - Career interests and matches
- `career_analytics` - Career tracking
- `relationship_progress` - Character relationships
- `platform_states` - Platform exploration

### 3. Career Data Generation
Convert tracked interactions into career explorations:
- Map career interests to specific careers
- Calculate match scores based on interactions
- Generate Birmingham-specific opportunities
- Determine readiness levels

### 4. Admin Dashboard Data Pipeline
Ensure all dashboard sections have real data:
- Skills: From `skill_summaries`
- Careers: From `career_explorations`
- Evidence: From all interaction data
- Gaps: Calculated from skills vs careers
- Action: From Birmingham opportunities

## Implementation Priority

1. **High Priority**: Fix career data generation
2. **High Priority**: Sync performance data
3. **Medium Priority**: Track relationship progress
4. **Medium Priority**: Comprehensive scene tracking
5. **Low Priority**: Enhanced career value tracking
