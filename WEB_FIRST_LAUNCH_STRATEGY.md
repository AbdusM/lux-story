# Web-First Launch Strategy: Validate Before Steam

**Goal:** Launch on web first, validate traction, then monetize on Steam with proven demand.

---

## 🎯 Why Launch Web First?

### Advantages
- ✅ **Zero cost** (no $100 Steam fee upfront)
- ✅ **Faster to market** (deploy today, no approval process)
- ✅ **Easier iteration** (update instantly, no Steam review)
- ✅ **Build audience** (email list, social following)
- ✅ **Validate concept** (does anyone actually want this?)
- ✅ **Test marketing** (see what works before Steam)
- ✅ **Gather feedback** (polish before Steam launch)
- ✅ **Build wishlist** (collect emails → convert to Steam wishlists)

### Disadvantages
- ❌ Harder to monetize (but solutions exist)
- ❌ Less "legitimate" feel (but many successful games started web)
- ❌ No Steam's built-in audience (but you build your own)

**Verdict:** Launch web first is the smarter move for indie devs.

## 🚀 Phase 1: Web Launch (Month 1-3)

### 1.1 Deploy to Web (Week 1)

**Where to deploy:**
1. **Your existing Cloudflare Pages** (you already have this!)
   - URL: `https://lux-story.pages.dev`
   - Free, fast, already set up
   - Custom domain optional

2. **itch.io** (Recommended for games)
   - Free to publish
   - Game-focused audience
   - Can set price (even $0 = free)
   - Built-in analytics
   - Easy to update

3. **Both!** (Why not?)

**Deployment steps:**
```bash
# Already done! Just ensure it's live
npm run build
npm run deploy  # or your existing deploy script
```

### 1.2 Set Up Analytics

**Track everything:**
- [ ] Google Analytics (free)
- [ ] Cloudflare Analytics (if using Cloudflare Pages)
- [ ] Custom event tracking (button clicks, choices made)
- [ ] Email signup form (build your list!)

**Key metrics to track:**
- Page views
- Unique visitors
- Time spent playing
- Completion rate (how many finish an arc?)
- Return visitors
- Email signups

### 1.3 Create Landing Page

**Simple landing page with:**
- [ ] Game description
- [ ] Screenshots/GIFs
- [ ] "Play Now" button (links to game)
- [ ] Email signup ("Get notified when we launch on Steam")
- [ ] Social links (TikTok, Twitter)

**Example:**
```

```

### 1.4 Launch Announcement

- [ ] Use web version as "demo"

**Steam page copy:**

It's a narrative game where you meet Lux, a sloth in a digital forest, and discover your career path through contemplative choices. No scores, no achievements, no pressure - just calm exploration.

I built it to help people discover careers through play, not testing. It uses behavioral psychology to adapt to your pace.
