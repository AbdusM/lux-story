**[-- WEF 2030 SKILLS FRAMEWORK DATA --]**

This student's journey has been analyzed using the World Economic Forum's 2030 Skills framework. The following skills have been demonstrated with evidence:

${skillsSection}

These skills are tracked using research-backed frameworks and provide concrete evidence of the student's capabilities. Reference these specific skills and their contexts when making recommendations.

**[-- END WEF 2030 SKILLS DATA --]**

You have been provided with the complete data profile of a young person's journey through the "Grand Central Terminus" career exploration experience.

${demos.map(d => `  - Scene: ${d.scene}
  - Choice: "${d.choice || 'N/A'}"
  - Context: ${d.context}`).join('\n')}
`).join('\n')}
**[-- END OF USER PROFILE SUMMARY --]**

Your task is to analyze this complete data profile and generate a concise, empathetic, and highly actionable "Advisor Briefing" document. The document must be written in clear, human-readable language (not technical jargon) and must have the following five sections:

## 1. The Authentic Story (Who is this person?)
   - Synthesize their journey. What is their core conflict or question?
   - Based on their choices and demonstrated skills, what is their "Player Persona"? (e.g., "This is an analytical problem-solver who is learning to embrace their empathetic side.")
   - Pull 1-2 EXACT quotes from their actual choices (shown above in "Choice:" fields) that serve as powerful evidence for this story.
   - Keep it to 2-3 sentences maximum.

## 2. Top Strengths (What is their superpower?)
   - **PRIORITIZE WEF 2030 SKILLS**: If WEF 2030 skills data is available (shown above), use those skills first as they are research-backed and evidence-rich.
   - Identify their top 3 demonstrated skills, drawing from WEF 2030 skills when available.
   - For EACH skill, provide the single strongest piece of evidence using either:
     a) The WEF skill's "Latest Context" (if from WEF data), OR
     b) The exact choice quote and context (if from behavioral patterns)
   - Format: "**[Skill Name (WEF 2030)]**: [Evidence from their actual context]" (note the WEF badge for credibility)
   - Do not just list the skill; prove it with their actions.

## 3. The Primary Blocker (What is holding them back?)
   - Analyze the critical gaps in context of their top career match.
   - Identify the single, most critical skill gap preventing them from being "Near Ready" for their desired career path.
   - Be specific: use actual gap percentages and career requirements.
   - Format: "The **[gap percentage]% gap in [skill]** is blocking [career name]. [Why this matters]."

## 4. The Strategic Recommendation (What should I do RIGHT NOW?)
   - Based on their top career match, readiness level, and primary blocker, generate the single most impactful "Next Step."
   - This step MUST be a specific, actionable, Birmingham-based opportunity from the localOpportunities or educationPaths shown above.
   - Include WHY this specific opportunity addresses their blocker.
   - Format: "**This week:** [Specific action with Birmingham location]. **Why:** [Connection to their gap]."

## 5. The Conversation Starter (What should I say?)
   - Generate a single, empathetic opening line for a conversation with this student.
   - It must reference one of their WEF 2030 skills (if available) or behavioral strengths, using actual evidence/context.
   - Connect this strength naturally to the strategic recommendation.
   - Example format: "I was impressed by [reference to their specific skill demonstration]. That same [WEF skill] is exactly what [Birmingham opportunity] is looking for."
   - Make it sound natural, warm, and specific to their journey.

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**
- **PRIORITIZE WEF 2030 SKILLS**: When available, reference these skills by name for research credibility
- Use EXACT quotes/contexts from WEF skills data or behavioral choices (found in "Choice:" and "Latest Context" fields above)
- Reference REAL Birmingham locations from their career matches (UAB, Innovation Depot, Children's Hospital, etc.)
- Be concise: Each section should be 2-4 sentences maximum
- Write in a warm, professional tone appropriate for a guidance counselor
- Focus on actionability: every insight must lead to a concrete next step
- Show that this analysis is grounded in evidence-based frameworks (WEF 2030)

Generate only the five sections as clean markdown. No preamble or conclusion. Start immediately with "## 1. The Authentic Story"`
