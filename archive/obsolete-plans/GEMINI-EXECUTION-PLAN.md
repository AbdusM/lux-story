# Gemini AI Content Improvement - Execution Plan

## Overview
This plan outlines the systematic execution of three Gemini-powered applications to enhance Lux Story's content quality, consistency, and psychological effectiveness.

## Current Status

### âœ… Completed
- [x] Framework implementation (`gemini-content-framework.ts`)
- [x] Progressive dialogue formatting (13 scenes fixed)
- [x] Choice calibration script created
- [x] Adaptive content generator created
- [x] Character voice audit script created
- [x] Documentation written

### ðŸŽ¯ Ready for Execution
All three Gemini applications are ready to run and will systematically improve:
1. **Choice clarity** â†’ Better pattern detection
2. **Character consistency** â†’ Stronger narrative immersion
3. **Anxiety management** â†’ Responsive emotional support

## Phase 1: Pre-Execution Checklist (Day 1)

### Environment Setup
- [ ] Verify `GEMINI_API_KEY` in `.env.local`
- [ ] Test API connectivity: `npx tsx scripts/test-gemini.ts`
- [ ] Create backup of current game state
- [ ] Review current metrics:
  - Total scenes: ~100
  - Scenes with choices: ~75
  - Character dialogues: ~73

### Quality Baseline
- [ ] Run app locally and document current experience
- [ ] Screenshot key dialogue scenes
- [ ] Note any inconsistent character voices
- [ ] Record pattern detection accuracy

## Phase 2: Choice Calibration (Day 1-2)

### Execute
```bash
npx tsx scripts/run-choice-calibration.ts
```

### Expected Outcomes
- All 75 choice scenes analyzed
- ~20-30 scenes improved
- Each choice clearly mapped to: Analytical, Helping, Building, or Patience
- Generated report: `choice-calibration-report.txt`

### Validation
- [ ] Review changes in `useSimpleGame.ts`
- [ ] Test pattern detection accuracy
- [ ] Verify choices feel natural
- [ ] Check for any broken game flow

### Rollback Plan
If issues arise:
```bash
cp hooks/useSimpleGame.backup-[timestamp].ts hooks/useSimpleGame.ts
```

## Phase 3: Character Voice Consistency (Day 2-3)

### Execute
```bash
npx tsx scripts/run-voice-audit.ts
```

### Expected Outcomes
- 73 character dialogues analyzed
- ~15-25 dialogues refined
- Consistent voices for:
  - Devon: Analytical, systematic
  - Maya: Empathetic, conflicted
  - Samuel: Wise, calming
  - Jordan: Experienced, searching

### Validation
- [ ] Read through each character's scenes
- [ ] Verify personality consistency
- [ ] Check dialogue feels authentic
- [ ] Test emotional impact

### Quality Metrics
- Devon: Technical vocabulary usage
- Maya: Balance of medical/robotics references
- Samuel: Metaphorical language frequency
- Jordan: Career-switching terminology

## Phase 4: Adaptive Content Generation (Day 3-4)

### Execute
```bash
npx tsx scripts/generate-adaptive-content.ts
```

### Expected Outcomes
- 60+ anxiety-reducing snippets generated
- 4 emotional states covered
- Birmingham-specific affirmations created
- JSON library: `data/adaptive-snippets.json`

### Integration Steps
1. Import snippet library into game
2. Add state detection logic
3. Implement snippet display system
4. Test emotional responsiveness

### Implementation Code
```typescript
// In hooks/useSimpleGame.ts
import adaptiveSnippets from '../data/adaptive-snippets.json'

function getAdaptiveMessage(playerState: string): string {
  const relevant = adaptiveSnippets.snippets
    .filter(s => s.state === playerState)
  const selected = relevant[Math.floor(Math.random() * relevant.length)]
  return selected.content
}

// Add to game state
if (patternCounts.patience < 2 && choicesMade > 5) {
  showSnippet(getAdaptiveMessage('anxious'))
}
```

## Phase 5: Testing & Refinement (Day 4-5)

### Comprehensive Testing
- [ ] Full playthrough with all paths
- [ ] Test each character interaction
- [ ] Verify pattern detection accuracy
- [ ] Check adaptive content triggers
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness testing

### Performance Metrics
Track before/after:
- Average session duration
- Choice engagement rate
- Pattern detection accuracy
- Character trust building
- Completion rate

### User Testing Questions
1. Do choices feel more distinct?
2. Are character voices consistent?
3. Does the game feel more responsive to emotional state?
4. Are anxiety-reducing moments effective?

## Phase 6: Production Deployment (Day 5-6)

### Pre-Deployment
- [ ] Final backup of all files
- [ ] Commit all changes
- [ ] Run build: `npm run build`
- [ ] Test production build locally

### Deployment Steps
```bash
# 1. Ensure all changes committed
git status
git add -A
git commit -m "feat: apply Gemini AI content improvements"

# 2. Push to repository
git push origin career-exploration-birmingham

# 3. Deploy to production
npm run deploy
```

### Post-Deployment Monitoring
- [ ] Check production site functionality
- [ ] Monitor error logs
- [ ] Gather initial user feedback
- [ ] Track engagement metrics

## Continuous Improvement Pipeline

### Weekly Tasks
1. **Monday**: Review metrics and feedback
2. **Wednesday**: Run voice consistency check
3. **Friday**: Generate new adaptive content

### Monthly Tasks
1. Analyze pattern detection accuracy
2. Refine choice calibration rules
3. Update character profiles
4. Expand adaptive content library

### Automation Opportunities
Create GitHub Actions workflow:
```yaml
name: Content Quality Check
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * 1' # Weekly on Monday
jobs:
  quality-check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - run: npm install
      - run: npx tsx scripts/run-voice-audit.ts
      - run: npx tsx scripts/run-choice-calibration.ts
```

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative
- **Pattern Detection**: >85% accuracy
- **Voice Consistency**: >90% on-character
- **Anxiety Reduction**: 20% increase in calm moments
- **Engagement**: 15% longer sessions
- **Completion**: 10% higher finish rate

### Qualitative
- Players report feeling understood
- Characters feel like real people
- Choices feel meaningful
- Career exploration feels natural
- Birmingham connection strengthens

## Risk Management

### Potential Issues & Mitigations
1. **Rate Limiting**
   - Mitigation: Spread execution over multiple days
   - Backup: Increase delays between batches

2. **Over-correction**
   - Mitigation: Conservative confidence thresholds (0.8+)
   - Backup: Manual review of all changes

3. **Character voice drift**
   - Mitigation: Regular audits
   - Backup: Character profile documentation

4. **Technical debt**
   - Mitigation: Refactor after each phase
   - Backup: Maintain clean git history

## Next Steps After Execution

### Immediate (Week 1)
1. Monitor user engagement metrics
2. Gather qualitative feedback
3. Fix any reported issues
4. Document lessons learned

### Short-term (Month 1)
1. Expand adaptive content library
2. Fine-tune pattern thresholds

- **Weekly**: Detailed report with metrics
- **Monthly**: Strategic review and planning

### User Communication
- Release notes highlighting improvements
- Blog post about AI-enhanced narrative
