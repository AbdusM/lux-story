If you want more comprehensive research foundation:

1. **Cognitive Load Theory** (Sweller, 1988)
   - Justifies chat pacing and dialogue chunking
   - Supports information architecture decisions

2. **Self-Determination Theory** (Deci & Ryan, 2000)

   - Supports intrinsic motivation approach

3. **Limbic Learning / Emotional Neuroscience** (Immordino-Yang & Damasio, 2007)
   - Validates emotional regulation features
   - Supports affective learning approach

### üü¢ NOT NECESSARY
These are implementation details, not user-facing features:
- Metacognitive scaffolding (feature not heavily used)
- Executive function (internal tracking only)
- Polyvagal theory (conceptual, not active)
- Cognitive behavioral (analysis tool only)
