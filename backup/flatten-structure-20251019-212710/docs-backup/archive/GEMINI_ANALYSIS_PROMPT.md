# Google Gemini Analysis Prompt: Grand Central Terminus

## System Context
You are Google Gemini, providing a comprehensive technical and narrative analysis of a career exploration platform. Use your multimodal capabilities to evaluate both code architecture and user experience design.

## Project Overview
**Name**: Grand Central Terminus  
**Purpose**: Career exploration platform for Birmingham, Alabama workforce development  
**Target**: Youth ages 16-24 in Birmingham's 7-county region  
**Grant**: Competing for $250K Birmingham Catalyze Challenge  
**URL**: https://lux-story.pages.dev (when deployed)

## Analysis Request

### 1. TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE ANALYSIS

Analyze the codebase structure and identify:

```typescript
// Key files to evaluate:
- /lib/story-engine.ts (narrative flow system)
- /lib/grand-central-state.ts (career tracking state)
- /components/GameInterface.tsx (main game loop)
- /data/grand-central-story.json (173 scenes)
- /hooks/useSceneTransitions.ts (scene management)
```

**Questions:**
1. Is the JSON-based narrative scalable beyond Birmingham?
2. Can the state management handle 1000+ concurrent users?
3. Is the scene transition system maintainable?
4. How difficult would localization to other cities be?
5. Rate the code quality (1-10) with specific examples

### 2. NARRATIVE COHERENCE ANALYSIS

Evaluate the story progression:

**Chapter 1**: Mysterious arrival â†’ Platform discovery â†’ Time manipulation
**Chapter 2**: Career value exploration â†’ Character relationships  
**Chapter 3**: Birmingham opportunities â†’ Practical action

**Critical Questions:**
1. Does the train station metaphor effectively convey career exploration?
2. Is the future-self letter device compelling or confusing?
3. Do the character crises (Maya's failed exam, Jordan's lost relationship) feel authentic?
4. Does the progression from mystical to practical work?
5. Rate narrative coherence (1-10) with specific breaks

### 3. USER EXPERIENCE ANALYSIS

Evaluate these specific implementations:

```javascript
// Text presentation system
- Left-aligned narration
- Pokemon-style dialogue boxes  
- Character emoji indicators (ðŸš‚ ðŸ”¬ ðŸ”§)
- Color-coded speaker text

// Choice system
- 1-4 choices per scene
- Consequence mapping to career values
- No save/load (intentional)
- No statistics (intentional)
```

**UX Questions:**
1. Will 17-year-olds understand the platform metaphors?
2. Is the lack of save/load frustrating or focusing?
3. Do choices feel meaningful or arbitrary?
4. Is text breaking appropriate for mobile?
5. Rate UX effectiveness (1-10) with improvements

### 4. BIRMINGHAM INTEGRATION ANALYSIS

Evaluate local authenticity:

**Specific Birmingham Elements:**
- UAB Medical Center, Children's Hospital
- Innovation Depot, Regions Bank
- Sloss Furnaces history, ACIPCO references
- Real wages: $19-35/hour programs
- Real people: Patricia Williams, Dr. Zhang

**Integration Questions:**
1. Does Birmingham feel authentic or touristy?
2. Are career paths realistically connected to actual opportunities?
3. Is the progression from platforms to real applications believable?
4. Would Birmingham youth recognize and trust these references?
5. Rate Birmingham authenticity (1-10)

### 5. EDUCATIONAL VALUE ANALYSIS

Evaluate career exploration effectiveness:

**Career Value Tracking:**
```javascript
careerValues: {
  directImpact: 0,     // Healthcare, service
  systemsThinking: 0,  // Engineering, construction
  dataInsights: 0,     // Analytics, technology
  futureBuilding: 0,   // Renewable, emerging
  independence: 0      // Entrepreneurship
}
```

**Educational Questions:**
1. Does the system effectively identify career interests?
2. Are the career categories comprehensive enough?
3. Is the values-to-careers mapping valid?
4. Would this replace or supplement traditional career counseling?
5. Rate educational value (1-10)

### 6. COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS

Compare to existing tools:

| Tool | Strength | Weakness | GCT Comparison |
|------|----------|----------|----------------|
| 16Personalities | Widespread adoption | Generic careers | More localized? |
| O*NET Interest Profiler | Comprehensive | Boring | More engaging? |
| 80,000 Hours | Impact focus | Elite bias | More accessible? |
| LinkedIn Career Explorer | Real jobs | Adult-focused | More youth-friendly? |

**Is Grand Central Terminus better for Birmingham youth? Why/why not?**

### 7. GRANT WORTHINESS ANALYSIS

Evaluate against grant criteria:

**Birmingham Catalyze Challenge Goals:**
- Workforce development âœ“/?
- Youth engagement âœ“/?
- Scalable solution âœ“/?
- Measurable impact âœ“/?
- Community integration âœ“/?

**Critical Assessment:**
1. Does this solve a real Birmingham problem?
2. Is $250K justified for this approach?
3. What's the cost per youth served?
4. How would you measure success?
5. Rate grant worthiness (1-10)

3. **Cultural blindspot**: What assumptions might offend?
4. **Competitive threat**: What makes this obsolete?
5. **Grant killer**: What one thing loses the funding?
