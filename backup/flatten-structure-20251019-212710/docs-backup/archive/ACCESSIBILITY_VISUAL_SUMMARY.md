# Admin Dashboard Accessibility: Visual Before/After Summary
**Quick Reference Guide**

## 🎯 THE BIG PICTURE

**Problem:** Admin dashboard uses technical jargon that confuses counselors, parents, and students
**Solution:** Two-mode viewing system with plain English throughout

## 📊 TAB-BY-TAB TRANSFORMATIONS

### **1. URGENCY TAB**

#### Narrative Improvements

**BEFORE (47 words, passive, buried lede):**
> Jordan is showing 78% urgency primarily due to disengagement patterns. They've visited only 2 scenes in the last 5 days despite making 8 choices in their first session. The gap between initial engagement and recent activity suggests they may be stuck or uncertain about next steps.

**AFTER - Personal View (18 words, active, action-oriented):**
> 🚨 Jordan stopped playing 5 days ago after a strong start (8 choices). Might be stuck. **Action:** Reach out today.

**AFTER - Research Mode (22 words, technical but concise):**
> Disengagement pattern detected. Initial session: 8 choices. Recent: 2 scenes/5 days. Gap suggests intervention needed. **Priority:** Immediate contact.

## 📏 WRITING RULES AT A GLANCE

### Narrative Bridges

```
Formula: [Achievement] — [Outcome]. [Directive].

✅ Good: "Jamal's shown 12 skills—here's where they lead. Focus on 'Near Ready' careers first."
❌ Bad: "Based on skill demonstrations, career pathways are presented with match scores."

Length: <25 words MAX
Tone: Conversational, encouraging
Always: Include student name
```

### Glass Box Urgency

```
Formula: [Emoji] [Name] [PROBLEM]. [Hypothesis]. **Action:** [Directive with timeframe].

Critical: 🚨 + 15-20 words + "today"/"immediately"
High:     🟠 + 20-25 words + "this week"/"soon"
Medium:   🟡 + 25-30 words + "within 2 weeks"
Low:      ✅ + 30-40 words + "monthly check-in"
```

### Empty States

```
Formula: [Positive emoji] [Good news]. [When to check back or action].

✅ Good: "✨ Career possibilities ahead! Careers appear as you explore different story paths."
❌ Bad: "No career explorations yet."
```
