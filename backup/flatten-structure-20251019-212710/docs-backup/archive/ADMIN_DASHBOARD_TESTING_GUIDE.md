- Chart render: <500ms
- Cross-tab navigation: <200ms
- Animation frame time: <16.7ms

**If Budget Exceeded:**
1. Profile with Chrome DevTools Performance
2. Identify bottlenecks (JavaScript execution, rendering, layout)
3. Optimize (lazy load, memoize, debounce)
4. Re-test until within budget

### Known Browser Issues & Workarounds

**Safari Date Parsing:**
- Issue: Safari strict about date formats
- Workaround: Use `new Date('2025-10-03T22:59:00')` (ISO 8601), not `new Date('10/3/2025')`

**Firefox Focus Outline:**
- Issue: Firefox uses dotted outline (not solid like Chrome)
- Workaround: Add custom focus styles: `outline: 2px solid #3b82f6; outline-offset: 2px;`

**iOS Safari Zoom on Input:**
- Issue: iOS zooms when input font-size <16px
- Workaround: Set all input font-size to 16px minimum

**Safari Sticky Positioning:**
- Issue: Safari requires `-webkit-sticky` prefix (older versions)
- Workaround: Use both `position: -webkit-sticky; position: sticky;`
