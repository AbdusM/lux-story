# Best Choice Design System - Keeping Users Engaged

## Philosophy: The Right Choices Guide Users to Deep Engagement

Similar to how we built the **best narrative** (A-grade on Rubric/BG3/Half-Life), now we build the **best choice system** that naturally guides users toward:
- Patience over rushing
- Empathy over detachment
- Trust-building over fact-gathering
- Deep engagement over surface clicking

---

## The Problem: Poorly Designed Choices Drive Surface Engagement

### ❌ **BAD Choice Design** (Leads to Quiz Mentality)

**Maya**: "I'm studying pre-med but I have robotics parts everywhere..."

**Choices**:
1. "Why pre-med?" (analytical)
2. "Why robotics?" (analytical)
3. "Tell me more about your studies." (exploring)

**Problem**:
- All 3 choices are **fact-gathering**
- No emotional option
- No patience option
- **Result**: User treats as interview, trust stays at 0

---

### ✅ **GOOD Choice Design** (Guides to Deep Engagement)

**Maya**: "I'm studying pre-med but I have robotics parts everywhere..."

**Choices**:
1. "Pre-med and robotics? That's an interesting combination." (analytical)
2. **"You're trying to be two things at once."** (helping, +1 trust) ⭐
3. "This station appears when we need it most. Why are you here?" (exploring)

**Why This Works**:
- Choice 2 is **emotionally resonant** and gets rewarded (+1 trust)
- Choice 2 **names the struggle** (BG3 principle: see the person)
- User is **guided** to empathetic response
- Still offers analytical/exploring for variety

---

## Three-Choice Architecture: The Golden Pattern

Every node should follow this pattern:

```
Choice 1: Analytical/Observational (Safe, 0 trust)
Choice 2: Empathetic/Helping (Rewarded, +1 trust) ⭐ DEFAULT DRAW
Choice 3: Patient/Alternative (Highest reward, +2 trust) ⭐⭐ EXCEPTIONAL
```

### Example: Maya's Anxiety Reveal

**Maya**: "Everyone sees me as perfect. But late at night, I'm actually... doing something else."

**Current Choices** (Good):
1. "What are you actually doing?" (exploring, 0 trust)
2. "It's okay to have your own interests." (helping, +1 trust) ⭐
3. **"[Say nothing. Wait.]"** (patience, +2 trust) ⭐⭐

**Why This Works**:
- Choice 2 **clearly** more empathetic than Choice 1
- Choice 3 **visually distinct** (`[brackets]` signal special)
- **Progressive rewards**: 0 → +1 → +2 trust
- User is **gently guided** to deeper choices

---

## Best Practices for Choice Design

### 1. **Make Empathy Obvious**

❌ **BAD**: All choices sound similar
```
1. "Tell me about that."
2. "What do you mean?"
3. "Can you explain?"
```

✅ **GOOD**: Empathy clearly stands out
```
1. "What do you mean?" (neutral)
2. "That sounds really hard." (empathetic) ⭐
3. "Tell me more." (neutral)
```

**Principle**: Users should be able to **see** which choice is caring

---

### 2. **Signal Patience with Brackets**

❌ **BAD**: Patience looks like any other choice
```
1. "What happened next?"
2. "Wait for them to continue"
3. "Tell me more"
```

✅ **GOOD**: Patience visually distinct
```
1. "What happened next?"
2. "Tell me more"
3. **"[Wait for them to continue]"** ⭐⭐
```

**Principle**: `[Brackets]` signal "this is special" - users learn to look for them

---

### 3. **Reward the Best Choice More**

❌ **BAD**: All choices give same reward
```
1. "What do you think?" (+1 trust)
2. "That must be hard." (+1 trust)
3. "[Wait]" (+1 trust)
```

✅ **GOOD**: Progressive rewards
```
1. "What do you think?" (0 trust)
2. "That must be hard." (+1 trust) ⭐
3. **"[Wait]"** (+2 trust) ⭐⭐
```

**Principle**: Players learn that patience/empathy = better outcomes

---

### 4. **Name the Emotion, Not Just Facts**

❌ **BAD**: Only factual responses
```
1. "What are you studying?"
2. "When did this start?"
3. "What do your parents think?"
```

✅ **GOOD**: Emotional recognition available
```
1. "What are you studying?"
2. **"You seem really conflicted."** ⭐
3. "What do your parents think?"
```

**Principle**: Give users language for emotions (teaching empathy)

---

### 5. **Avoid "Quiz Mode" Traps**

❌ **BAD**: All interrogative
```
1. "Why did you choose pre-med?"
2. "Why robotics?"
3. "Why not just tell them?"
```

✅ **GOOD**: Mix questions with statements
```
1. "What drew you to pre-med?" (question)
2. **"You're carrying a lot of weight."** (statement) ⭐
3. "Have you talked to them?" (question)
```

**Principle**: Statements create connection, not just information exchange

---

## The "Default Draw" Principle

**Users will naturally gravitate to the middle choice** (Choice 2). Make it the empathetic one.

### Example: Maya's Deflection

**Maya**: "Yes, pre-med... it's going great. Really great. My parents are so proud."

**Choices** (Optimal Order):
1. "Tell me about pre-med." (analytical, safe)
2. **"You said 'my parents' not 'I am'."** (analytical + empathy, +1 trust) ⭐ DEFAULT
3. "This place helps people at crossroads." (exploring)

**Why This Order**:
- Choice 2 is **most interesting** (catches deflection)
- Choice 2 **rewards engagement** (+1 trust)
- User who reads carefully naturally drawn to Choice 2
- User gets **positive feedback** for attention

---

## Progressive Difficulty: Teaching Users to Engage

### Early Game (Trust 0-2): Make Empathy OBVIOUS

```
Maya: "I'm so stressed about this exam..."

Choices:
1. "What subject?"
2. "That sounds really stressful." ⭐ CLEARLY EMPATHETIC
3. "Tell me more."
```

### Mid Game (Trust 3-5): Subtler Cues

```
Maya: "My parents will be so disappointed."

Choices:
1. "Why would they be disappointed?"
2. "You're not responsible for their emotions." ⭐ EMPATHETIC BUT SUBTLE
3. "What did they say?"
```

### Late Game (Trust 6+): Emotional Intelligence Required

```
Maya: "I called them last night. Told them everything."

Choices:
1. "What did they say?"
2. "How do you feel?" ⭐ FOCUSING ON HER, NOT PARENTS
3. "[Wait]" ⭐⭐ MASTERY LEVEL
```

**Principle**: **Train users progressively** - start obvious, get subtle

---

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### ❌ **Anti-Pattern 1: All Analytical**

```
1. "What do you mean?"
2. "Can you explain?"
3. "Why is that?"
```
**Problem**: No emotional pathway, forces detachment

---

### ❌ **Anti-Pattern 2: False Patience**

```
1. "Tell me more."
2. "Go on."
3. "[Wait]"
```
**Problem**: Choices 1-2 are also "waiting," so brackets don't signal anything special

---

### ❌ **Anti-Pattern 3: Empathy Hidden in Last Position**

```
1. "What subject?"
2. "When is the exam?"
3. "That sounds stressful." ⭐
```
**Problem**: Best choice hidden in position 3, users default to position 2 (quiz question)

---

### ❌ **Anti-Pattern 4: No Reward Differentiation**

```
1. "What do you think?" (0 trust)
2. "That must be hard." (0 trust)
3. "[Wait]" (0 trust)
```
**Problem**: No incentive to choose empathy, all choices feel same

---

## Optimal Choice Patterns by Character Arc Stage

### **Introduction** (Trust 0-1)
```
Pattern: Analytical (safe) | Empathetic (rewarded) | Exploring (neutral)
Goal: Guide user to empathy

Example:
1. "Pre-med and robotics?" (analytical, 0)
2. "You're trying to be two things at once." (helping, +1) ⭐
3. "Why are you here?" (exploring, 0)
```

---

### **Trust Building** (Trust 2-4)
```
Pattern: Surface Question | Deep Recognition | Patience
Goal: Teach patience rewards more

Example:
1. "What happened?" (exploring, 0)
2. "That must have been difficult." (helping, +1) ⭐
3. "[Wait for them to continue]" (patience, +2) ⭐⭐
```

---

### **Revelation** (Trust 5+)
```
Pattern: Fact Question | Emotional Recognition | Silence
Goal: Reward emotional intelligence

Example:
1. "What did they say?" (analytical, 0)
2. "How do YOU feel about it?" (helping, +1) ⭐
3. "[Say nothing]" (patience, +2) ⭐⭐
```

---

### **Resolution** (Trust 7+)
```
Pattern: Advice | Affirmation | Presence
Goal: Show user they've built real relationship

Example:
1. "You should talk to them again." (helping, 0)
2. "You've already shown incredible courage." (helping, +1) ⭐
3. "[Sit with them in silence]" (patience, +2) ⭐⭐
```

---

## Real Examples from Current Game (Evaluation)

### ✅ **EXCELLENT**: Maya's Anxiety Reveal

**Maya**: "Everyone sees me as perfect. But late at night, I'm actually... doing something else."

**Choices**:
1. "What are you actually doing?" (exploring, 0)
2. "It's okay to have your own interests." (helping, +1) ⭐
3. "[Say nothing. Wait.]" (patience, +2) ⭐⭐

**Why This Works**:
- Clear progression: 0 → +1 → +2
- Empathy in position 2 (default draw)
- Patience visually distinct (`[brackets]`)
- Each choice feels different

**Grade**: **A** ✅

---

### ✅ **EXCELLENT**: Maya's Deflection

**Maya**: "Yes, pre-med... it's going great. Really great. My parents are so proud."

**Choices**:
1. "You said 'my parents' not 'I am'." (analytical + empathy, +1) ⭐
2. "But is it what YOU want?" (helping, requires trust 2+)

**Why This Works**:
- Choice 1 **rewards reading carefully**
- Choice 2 **gates on trust** (teaches progression)
- Both are empathetic (no pure fact-gathering)
- Choices teach user to read subtext

**Grade**: **A** ✅

---

### ⚠️ **GOOD BUT COULD BE BETTER**: Samuel's Hub

**Samuel**: "Who would you like to speak with?"

**Choices**:
1. "Maya Chen - Platform 1"
2. "Devon Kumar - Platform 3"
3. "Jordan Packard - Conference Room B"

**Why This Is Just Okay**:
- Pure navigation (no emotional engagement)
- All choices equal weight
- No teaching moment

**How to Improve**:
```
1. "Maya Chen - She seems really anxious." (shows observation)
2. "Devon Kumar - Something about systems and grief?" (shows curiosity)
3. "Actually, tell me more about this station first." (builds Samuel relationship)
```

**Grade**: **B** (functional but missed opportunity)

## Choice Design Checklist

For every dialogue node, verify:

### ☑️ **Variety Check**
- [ ] At least one analytical option (safe)
- [ ] At least one empathetic option (rewarded)
- [ ] At least one patience/silence option (high reward) OR alternative path

### ☑️ **Reward Structure Check**
- [ ] Empathy gives +1 trust minimum
- [ ] Patience gives +2 trust (if present)
- [ ] At least one choice advances trust
- [ ] Best choice is clearly better reward

### ☑️ **Visual Design Check**
- [ ] Patience choices use `[brackets]`
- [ ] Empathy choice in position 2 (default draw)
- [ ] No more than 3 choices (decision fatigue)
- [ ] Each choice feels distinctly different

### ☑️ **Emotion Check**
- [ ] At least one choice names an emotion
- [ ] Not all interrogative ("Why?" "What?")
- [ ] At least one statement, not just questions
- [ ] Emotional recognition option available

### ☑️ **Teaching Check**
- [ ] User can learn from choice outcomes
- [ ] Progressive difficulty (easier early, harder late)
- [ ] Rewards teach desired behavior
- [ ] Anti-quiz patterns avoided

---

## Implementation: Audit Current Choices

### Script to Find Potential Issues

```typescript
// Find nodes with no empathetic choices
function auditChoices(nodes: DialogueNode[]) {
  const issues = []
  
  for (const node of nodes) {
    const choices = node.choices || []
    
    // Check 1: Does this node have an empathetic option?
    const hasEmpathy = choices.some(c => 
      c.pattern === 'helping' || c.pattern === 'patience'
    )
    
    if (!hasEmpathy && choices.length > 0) {
      issues.push({
        nodeId: node.nodeId,
        issue: 'No empathetic choice available',
        severity: 'high'
      })
    }
    
    // Check 2: Does this node reward empathy more than analysis?
    const empathyReward = Math.max(...choices
      .filter(c => c.pattern === 'helping' || c.pattern === 'patience')
      .map(c => c.consequence?.trustChange || 0)
    )
    
    const analysisReward = Math.max(...choices
      .filter(c => c.pattern === 'analytical')
      .map(c => c.consequence?.trustChange || 0)
    )
    
    if (analysisReward > empathyReward) {
      issues.push({
        nodeId: node.nodeId,
        issue: 'Analytical choice rewards more than empathy',
        severity: 'medium'
      })
    }
    
    // Check 3: Are all choices interrogative?
    const allQuestions = choices.every(c => 
      c.text.includes('?') || c.text.toLowerCase().startsWith('what ') ||
      c.text.toLowerCase().startsWith('why ') || c.text.toLowerCase().startsWith('how ')
    )
    
    if (allQuestions && choices.length > 2) {
      issues.push({
        nodeId: node.nodeId,
        issue: 'All choices are questions (quiz mode)',
        severity: 'low'
      })
    }
  }
  
  return issues
}
```

## The "Keep Users Engaged" Formula

### Formula:
```
Engagement = (Empathy Options × Trust Rewards) + (Patience Options × 2) - (Quiz Mode Traps)
```

### Breakdown:

1. **Empathy Options** (×1): Clear empathetic choices available
2. **Trust Rewards** (×1): Empathy gets rewarded with trust
3. **Patience Options** (×2): Silence/waiting options exist and reward highly
4. **Quiz Mode Traps** (-1): All interrogative, no statements

### Example Scoring:

**Node A** (Poor):
```
Choices: "What?", "Why?", "When?"
Empathy: 0, Trust Rewards: 0, Patience: 0, Quiz Mode: -1
Score: 0 + 0 + 0 - 1 = -1 ❌
```

**Node B** (Excellent):
```
Choices: "What happened?", "That must be hard", "[Wait]"
Empathy: 1, Trust Rewards: +1, Patience: +2, Quiz Mode: 0
Score: 1 + 1 + 2 - 0 = 4 ✅
```

---

## Next Steps: Systematic Choice Improvement

### Phase 1: Audit (1 day)
- Run audit script on all dialogue nodes
- Identify nodes with no empathetic options
- Identify nodes with no patience options
- Identify quiz mode traps

### Phase 2: Fix High-Priority (2 days)
- Add empathetic choices to nodes that lack them
- Increase trust rewards for empathy > analysis
- Add `[Wait]` options to emotional moments

### Phase 3: Polish (1 day)
- Reorder choices (empathy in position 2)
- Ensure progressive difficulty
- Test choice variety

### Phase 4: Validate (ongoing)
- Monitor: % of users choosing patience
- Monitor: Trust progression rates
- Monitor: Optional content discovery
- A/B test: Different choice orderings

---

## Philosophy: Choice Design IS Engagement Design

**Bad narrative** = Users don't care  
**Bad choices** = Users engage wrong way

**Good narrative** + **Good choices** = Deep engagement

**We've built A-grade narrative. Now we need A-grade choices.**

---

## Practical Application

### Before Writing ANY New Dialogue Node:

1. **Ask**: What's the emotional beat here?
2. **Design**: Analytical (safe) | Empathetic (rewarded) | Patient (exceptional)
3. **Order**: Put empathy in position 2 (default draw)
4. **Reward**: Empathy = +1, Patience = +2
5. **Visual**: Use `[brackets]` for patience
6. **Test**: Does this teach the user to engage deeper?

---

**This is how we keep users engaged: by designing choices that guide them to depth, not leaving them to find it accidentally.**
