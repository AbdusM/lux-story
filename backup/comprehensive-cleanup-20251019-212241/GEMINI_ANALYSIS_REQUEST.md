## Code Architecture Sample
### Story Engine (TypeScript)
```typescript
// Use the Grand Central Terminus narrative
import storyData from '@/data/grand-central-story.json'

/**
 * Represents a single scene in the story
 */
export interface Scene {
  /** Unique scene identifier (e.g., '2-3') */
  id: string
  /** Type of scene interaction */
  type: 'narration' | 'dialogue' | 'choice'
  /** Character speaking (optional) */
  speaker?: string
  /** Scene text content */
  text?: string
  /** Available choices for choice scenes */
  choices?: Choice[]
}

/**
 * Represents a player choice option - no costs, just text
 */
export interface Choice {
  /** Display text for the choice */
  text: string
  /** Consequence tag for tracking */
  consequence: string
  /** Scene ID to transition to after choice */
  nextScene: string
  /** State changes to apply when choice is made */
  stateChanges?: any
}

/**
 * Simplified story engine - just story, no manipulation
 */
export class StoryEngine {
  private chapters = storyData.chapters
  
  /**
   * Get a scene by ID
   */
  getScene(sceneId: string): Scene | null {
    const [chapterNum, sceneNum] = sceneId.split('-').map(Number)
    const chapter = this.chapters.find(c => c.id === chapterNum)
    if (!chapter) return null
    
    const scene = chapter.scenes.find(s => s.id === sceneId)
    if (!scene) return null
    
    // Return scene without any modifications or enhancements
    return {
      id: scene.id,
      type: scene.type as Scene['type'],
      speaker: scene.speaker,
      text: scene.text,
      choices: scene.choices?.map(c => ({
        text: c.text,
        consequence: c.consequence,
        nextScene: c.nextScene,
        stateChanges: (c as any).stateChanges
      }))
    }
  }
  
  /**
   * Get the next scene ID in sequence
   */
  getNextScene(currentSceneId: string): string | null {
    // For Grand Central Terminus, most scenes are choice-driven
    // Only simple sequential scenes should auto-advance
    
    // Extract chapter and scene number (handles patterns like 2-3
```

## Narrative Samples
### Opening Scene
{
  "id": "1-1",
  "type": "narration",
  "text": "The letter arrived this morning, slipped under your door while the world slept. The paper felt thick between your fingers, expensive, with a faint smell of brass polish.\n\n'Your future awaits at Platform 7. Midnight. Don't be late.'\n\nNo signature. No postmark. Just your name written in handwriting that feels familiar but impossible to place.\n\nNow you're standing at the entrance to Grand Central Terminus - a station that wasn't here yesterday. Cold November air bites at your exposed skin. The clock tower shows 11:47 PM, its mechanical tick echoing against wet concrete.\n\nThirteen minutes to find Platform 7. Thirteen minutes to meet your future.\n\nIf you believe the letter."
}

### Character Crisis Example
{
  "id": "2-3a2",
  "type": "dialogue",
  "speaker": "Maya",
  "text": "You notice the warmth too? Platform 1's been glowing differently since... whatever you did during that frozen moment.\n\nLook, can I tell you something? I failed my anatomy exam last week. First time I've ever failed anything. My parents called it 'a minor setback.' They don't know I threw up before the test because I couldn't remember if the radial nerve runs over or under the supinator. Four years of straight A's, and suddenly I can't even hold a scalpel without my hand shaking."
}
