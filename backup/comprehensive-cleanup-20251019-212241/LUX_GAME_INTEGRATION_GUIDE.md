# Lux Integration Guide
*How the backstory translates into game experience*

---

## Core Philosophy in Practice

The backstory establishes Lux as a being without urgency, wisdom, or answers. This should permeate every interaction.

---

## Sample Game Interactions

### Opening Scene
```
You find yourself in a digital forest. 
A sloth hangs from a branch.

This is Lux.

Lux doesn't greet you. 
Greetings imply you weren't already here.

[Continue]
[Wait]
[Leave]
```
*All choices lead to the same next moment, just at different speeds*

---

### Career Anxiety Moment
```
PLAYER: "I don't know what to do with my life."

LUX: "..."

[Wait for Lux to respond]
[Fill the silence yourself]  
[Move on]

(If waiting 30 seconds):
LUX: "The branch holds me whether I know what to do or not."
```

---

### Meditation Pressure
```
PLAYER: "I'm bad at meditation."

LUX: (after a long pause)
"You're breathing. 
That's all the meditation that's happening."

[But I can't clear my mind]
[But I can't sit still]
[...]

LUX: "Neither can I."
```

---

### Job Interview Scenario
```
"There's an interview tomorrow."

LUX: "Tomorrow isn't here."

[But I need to prepare]
[You're right]
[That doesn't help]

LUX: "Today is here."

(After 60 seconds of silence):
LUX: "The interview will happen or won't. 
You'll get the job or won't.
Either way, Thursday will come."
```

## Hidden Revelations for Patient Players

### 15 Seconds of Stillness:
"A pixel-bird lands near Lux. It was always there. You just started noticing."

### 1 Minute:
"Lux blinks. It takes four seconds. This is the fastest Lux moves."

### 5 Minutes:
"You realize Lux hasn't moved because Lux is already where Lux is going."

### 10 Minutes:
"The career you're worried about is happening to someone. That someone might be you. Or might not. The forest doesn't distinguish."

### 30 Minutes:
"Nothing has happened. Everything has happened. These are the same."

---

## Dialogue Principles

### Lux Never Says:
- "You should..."
- "The key to success is..."
- "Let me teach you..."
- "The answer is..."
- "Follow your dreams..."

### Lux Might Say:
- "Oh."
- "The morning came anyway."
- "That's a thought you're having."
- "I'm still here."
- "..."

---

## Choice Design Based on Backstory

### Traditional Game Choices:
- [Fight] or [Flee]
- [Accept Quest] or [Refuse]  
- [Save the World] or [Let it Burn]

### Lux Experience Choices:
- [Sit] or [Hang] or [Lean]
- [Listen to the data-rain] or [Count your breaths] or [Do neither]
- [Think about work] or [Think about not-work] or [Think about thinking]

*All choices lead forward at different speeds, none are wrong*

---

## Environmental Details from Backstory

### The Digital Forest Contains:
- Branches that hold weight without physics
- Data-rain that falls upward sometimes
- Shadows with temperature but no sun
- Time that passes without clocks
- Distance that exists without measurement

### What Players Won't Find:
- Quest markers
- Objective indicators
- Progress bars
- Achievement notifications
- Completion percentages

---

## Career Scenarios Without Advice

### Promotion Opportunity
```
"A promotion appeared in your inbox."

[Open it]
[Delete it]
[Let it sit]

LUX: "Inboxes fill. Inboxes empty. Inboxes fill."
```

### Career Change Contemplation  
```
"You could do something completely different."

[But I've invested so much]
[But I don't know what]
[But I'm scared]

LUX: "You could."
```

### Unemployment
```
"The job ended."

[I'm a failure]
[I'm free]
[I'm scared]

LUX: "You're here."
```

---

## Meditation Without Method

### When Players Seek Meditation Guidance:
```
PLAYER: "How do I meditate?"

LUX: "You're doing it or you're not. I can't tell which."

[That's not helpful]
[What do you mean?]
[...]

LUX: "I know."
```

---

## The Non-Ending

The experience doesn't conclude. It just stops when players stop. Like how Lux's story doesn't end - Lux just continues existing when you're not looking.

### Final Interaction:
```
You can leave anytime.
Lux will still be here.
Moving at the speed of Lux.

[Leave]
[Stay]
[Ask why]

LUX: (if asked why)
"Why what?"
```

---

## Implementation Reminders

1. **Every interaction should feel optional** - Players can always just sit with Lux saying nothing
2. **Time should feel different** - Not slower, just unmetered
3. **Silence is content** - Long pauses are features, not bugs
4. **No transformation** - Players end where they began, just having spent time
5. **Questions over answers** - Lux asks more than tells

---

## The Core Loop Remains

**Read → Choose → Wait → Discover**

But now informed by a character who demonstrates that the loop itself is the experience, not a means to progress.

*Final Note: This guide should be invisible to players. They should feel Lux's presence, not see the architecture behind it.*
