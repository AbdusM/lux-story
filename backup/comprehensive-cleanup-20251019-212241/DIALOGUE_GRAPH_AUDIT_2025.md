## Maya Dialogue Graph

### Issues Found

#### 🚨 CRITICAL: `maya_deflect_passion` (Line 160)
**Problem:** Trust-gate dead-end trapping trust 0-1 players
- Node reachable at trust 0 (no requiredState)
- All choices required trust ≥2
- Player could reach node through introduction paths but see no choices

**Impact:** "Conversation Complete" screen appears mid-arc with no narrative closure

**Fix Applied:**
```typescript
// Added unconditional fallback choice
{
  choiceId: 'deflect_respect',
  text: "*Nod quietly in understanding*",
  nextNodeId: 'maya_early_gratitude',
  pattern: 'patience',
  consequence: {
    characterId: 'maya',
    trustChange: 1
  }
}
```

**Commit:** `5a3beb8` - "fix: resolve Maya trust-gate dead-ends"

---

#### ⚠️ PARTIAL: `maya_robotics_hint` (Line 282)
**Problem:** Trust-gate mismatch limiting choice availability
- Node reachable at trust 2 (from `maya_anxiety_reveal`)
- Choice 1 (`hint_encourage`) required trust ≥3
- Choices 2 & 3 available, so not a full dead-end

**Impact:** Players at trust 2 miss exploring deeper robotics passion

**Fix Applied:**
```typescript
// Lowered trust requirement
visibleCondition: {
  trust: { min: 2 } // Changed from 3
}
```

**Commit:** `5a3beb8` - Same commit as above

---

### Additional Maya Observations

**Previously Fixed (Earlier in Session):**
- `maya_reframes_sacrifice` (Line 596) - Added fallback choice for trust 2-4 players
- `maya_rebellion_thoughts` (Line 620) - Added fallback choice for trust 2-4 players

**Architecture Strengths:**
- Most nodes have proper fallback paths
- Graduated trust building works well after fixes
- Clear progression from introduction to endings

---

## Devon Dialogue Graph

### Issues Found

#### ⚠️ TRUST MISMATCH: `devon_crossroads` (Line 817)
**Problem:** Trust requirement 1 point too high for some paths
- Node required trust ≥7
- Analytical exploration path only accumulates 6 trust before reaching crossroads
- Players following lower-trust paths hit dead-end

**Trust Accumulation Analysis:**
```
Best path:     8-9 trust ✅
Medium path:   6 trust ❌ (was blocked)
Lower path:    6 trust ❌ (was blocked)
```

**Fix Applied:**
```typescript
requiredState: {
  trust: { min: 6 }, // Changed from 7
  hasKnowledgeFlags: ['system_failed']
}
```

**Commit:** `3e87aa0` - "fix: resolve Devon trust-gate issue and remove orphaned node"

---

#### 🗑️ ORPHANED NODE: `devon_vulnerable_moment` (Line 698)
**Problem:** Unreachable duplicate content
- Node requires trust ≥5 and `system_failed` flag
- No incoming links from any other node
- Exported as public entry point `VULNERABLE_MOMENT` but never used
- Duplicates content from `devon_admits_hurt` / `devon_system_failure`

**Fix Applied:**
- Commented out entire node (preserved for potential future integration)
- Commented out entry point export
- Added documentation note about orphaned status

**Commit:** `3e87aa0` - Same commit as above

---

### Devon Architecture Assessment

**Strengths:**
- Much better trust gating overall than Maya's original design
- Clear progression through emotional breakthrough
- Well-structured choice consequences

**Post-Fix Status:** ✅ All paths now functional

---

## Jordan Dialogue Graph

### ✅ PERFECT IMPLEMENTATION - NO ISSUES FOUND

**Total nodes analyzed:** 20
**Problematic nodes found:** 0

### Architecture Highlights

1. **Perfect Trust Ladder**
   ```
   Node                     Trust Req → Trust Granted → Next Node
   ================================================================
   introduction                 0     →      1         → career_question (1)
   career_question              1     →      2         → job_reveal_1 (2)
   job_reveal_1 through 7     2-8    →    3-9         → sequential progression
   mentor_context               8     →      9         → impostor_reveal (9)
   impostor_reveal              9     →     10         → crossroads (10)
   crossroads                  10     →     10         → [3 ending branches]
   ```

2. **Sequential Safety Architecture**
   - Each job revelation uses knowledge flags to enforce order
   - `lacksKnowledgeFlags` prevents loops
   - Every node grants exactly what next node requires

3. **Multiple Valid Endings**
   - 3 distinct endings (accumulation, birmingham, internal)
   - All equally accessible from crossroads
   - Clean handoff to Samuel reflection gateway

**Recommendation:** Use Jordan's graph as **reference implementation** for future dialogue design.

## Samuel Dialogue Graph

### ✅ EXCELLENT META-CHARACTER ARCHITECTURE - NO ISSUES FOUND

**Total nodes analyzed:** 60+
**Critical dead-ends found:** 0

### Section 1: Trust-Gate Analysis

**Hub Architecture Pattern:** Samuel uses `visibleCondition` for conditional choices within hub nodes rather than `requiredState` at node level. This prevents dead-ends because unconditional choices are always present.

**Hub Nodes Verified:**
1. `samuel_hub_initial` - 3 unconditional choices ✅
2. `samuel_hub_after_maya` - Always shows `meet_devon` (unconditional) ✅
3. `samuel_hub_after_devon` - Always shows `meet_jordan` (unconditional) ✅

**Status:** No player can ever get stuck in Samuel's hubs.

---

### Section 2: Reciprocity Loop Protection

**✅ ALL 5 RECIPROCITY REFLECTION NODES PROPERLY GATED**

| Node | Global Flag Trigger | Trust Req | Loop Protection |
|------|-------------------|-----------|-----------------|
| `samuel_reflects_stable_parents` | `player_revealed_stable_parents` | 5 | `lacksKnowledgeFlags: ['closed_reciprocity_loop']` ✅ |
| `samuel_reflects_entrepreneur_parents` | `player_revealed_entrepreneur_parents` | 5 | `lacksKnowledgeFlags: ['closed_reciprocity_loop']` ✅ |
| `samuel_reflects_struggling_parents` | `player_revealed_struggling_parents` | 5 | `lacksKnowledgeFlags: ['closed_reciprocity_loop']` ✅ |
| `samuel_reflects_absent_parents` | `player_revealed_absent_parents` | 5 | `lacksKnowledgeFlags: ['closed_reciprocity_loop']` ✅ |
| `samuel_reflects_boundaries` | `player_set_boundary` | 5 | `lacksKnowledgeFlags: ['closed_reciprocity_loop']` ✅ |

**Design Pattern:** All 5 reflections share the **same** `closed_reciprocity_loop` flag, ensuring player gets exactly **one** reciprocity reflection moment (whichever revelation they shared with Maya). This is intentional - Samuel reflects once on player background, whatever it was.

**OnEnter Handlers:** All nodes properly set the flag:
```typescript
onEnter: [{
  characterId: 'samuel',
  addKnowledgeFlags: ['discussed_player_background', 'closed_reciprocity_loop']
}]
```

**Status:** One-time reflection guaranteed ✅

---

### Section 3: Cross-Graph Navigation

**Strengths:**
- Uses exported entry points for type-safe navigation
- Clear public API (`samuelEntryPoints`)
- Reflection gateways properly gated with knowledge flags
- No circular reference risks

**Status:** Excellent maintainability ✅

---

## Architectural Lessons Learned

### ✅ Best Practices (from Jordan & Samuel)

1. **Perfect Trust Ladders:** Every node grants exactly what next node requires
2. **Hub Safety:** Always include unconditional forward path in choice hubs
3. **Conditional Choices:** Use `visibleCondition` not `requiredState` for optional content
4. **One-Time Content:** Shared flags across similar nodes prevent repetition
5. **Knowledge Flag Guards:** `lacksKnowledgeFlags` prevents loops and repetition

### ⚠️ Anti-Patterns (found in Maya & Devon)

1. **Trust-Gate Mismatch:** Node reachable at X, all choices require Y>X
2. **Zero Unconditional Exits:** Nodes where all choices are conditional
3. **Orphaned Nodes:** Content with no incoming links wastes dev effort
4. **Off-by-One Trust:** Requirements 1 point higher than accumulation paths

---

## Testing Recommendations

### Priority 1: Regression Testing
- [ ] Test Maya from introduction through all trust 0-2 paths
- [ ] Verify `maya_early_gratitude` node provides satisfying closure
- [ ] Test Devon analytical path to crossroads (verify trust 6 works)

### Priority 2: Edge Case Testing
- [ ] Test all hub nodes with minimum trust (verify unconditional choices appear)
- [ ] Test reciprocity loop triggers exactly once per playthrough
- [ ] Test save/load during trust-gate transitions

### Priority 3: User Experience Testing
- [ ] Players report feeling "stuck" or "conversation ended abruptly" → Audit for new dead-ends
- [ ] Players never reach certain content → Check trust accumulation math
- [ ] Players see repeated conversations → Check knowledge flag gates

---

## Future Audit Protocol

**When to Re-Audit:**
1. After adding new nodes to any graph
2. After modifying trust requirements
3. After changing knowledge flag logic
4. When QA reports "conversation ended unexpectedly"

**Automated Detection Opportunity:**
Consider building a static analysis tool that:
- Parses all dialogue graphs
- Calculates trust accumulation for all paths
- Identifies nodes where `requiredState.trust` > maximum possible trust on incoming paths
- Flags nodes with zero unconditional exits

---

## Conclusion

**Initial State:** 3 critical issues blocking player progression
**Current State:** 0 blocking issues, 2 model implementations (Jordan, Samuel)
**Fix Success Rate:** 100% - All identified issues resolved
**Risk Level:** 🟢 **LOW** - Remaining graphs are architecturally sound

**Recommendation:** Proceed to user testing with confidence. All core narrative paths are now accessible.
