## The Over-Engineering Crisis: Lessons Learned

### What Went Wrong (August 2024 - September 2025)

**Timeline of Complexity Explosion:**
- **August 2024**: Simple Pokemon-style career exploration (~500 lines)
- **September 2024**: Psychology systems integration (+2,000 lines)
- **September 2024**: AI/ML explosion (+300MB dependencies, runtime failures)
- **September 2025**: Architecture proliferation (33,283 total lines, 740MB bundle)
- **September 2025**: Nuclear reset to minimal implementation (554 lines, stable)

**Root Causes Identified:**
1. **Mission Creep**: From "simple career exploration" to "comprehensive psychological assessment platform"
2. **Technology-First Thinking**: Adding AI/ML before questioning necessity
3. **Academic Research Bias**: Conflating sophistication with user value
4. **Whack-a-Mole Development**: Fixing complexity with more complexity

**Quantified Impact:**
- **Code Explosion**: 500 → 33,283 lines (66x growth)
- **Bundle Bloat**: 50MB → 740MB (15x growth)
- **Feature Creep**: 8+ invisible analytics systems with zero user value
- **Reliability Crisis**: AI dependencies causing story progression failures

  environmentalState: PlatformWarmthMap
  birminghamConnections: LocalOpportunityState[]
}

// Phase 3+: Optional Supabase integration for dynamic content
// interface SupabaseIntegration {
