---

**Final Assessment**: The Lux Story system is fundamentally an enterprise-level career development platform with research-backed psychology integration, currently operating in a simplified mode for Phase 2 Birmingham integration testing. The audit reveals a codebase with significantly more sophisticated capabilities than initially apparent, with extensive dormant systems representing substantial intellectual property and development investment. The challenge is not building features but managing and surfacing the value already created.
