## Issues Requiring Attention

### Choices Needing Text Revision (5)
**maya-pressure-discussion**
- Current: "No, they're not. What does call to you?"
- Pattern: helping
- Issue: The original text, "No, they're not. What does call to you?", is weakly related to a helping pattern. While a helping person might use a similar phrase to gently guide someone, it lacks the explicit focus on other people's needs or well-being that defines the pattern.  The improved suggestions directly address motivations and impact, aligning better with the helping pattern by prompting reflection on how the person wants to contribute to others or solve problems for them.  The psychological fit is reasonable because a helping-oriented person might use indirect questioning to understand what motivates another.  The accuracy is low because of the original phrase's ambiguity.
- Suggested: ""What challenges or opportunities most excite you?"  or "What kind of impact would you like to make?""

**maya-robotics-reveal**
- Current: "UAB has biomedical engineering. Maybe that's your bridge?"
- Pattern: building
- Issue: While biomedical engineering does involve a "building" aspect in the creation of devices and solutions, the text focuses more on the bridging aspect which doesn't strongly convey the hands-on, creative nature of the "building" pattern.  The improved text highlights the relevant creative and solution-oriented aspects, improving its alignment with the building pattern. The psychology score is high because biomedical engineering is often a good fit for individuals with a desire to build and create solutions in a tangible way.
- Suggested: ""Biomedical engineering blends analytical problem-solving with hands-on design and creation of medical solutions.  It might be a good fit.""

**maya-pressure-discussion**
- Current: "Maybe excellence in one area can fund passion in another?"
- Pattern: building
- Issue: The original text is vague. While the sentiment of "building" something (a foundation, a skillset) is present, it's weakly expressed.  The phrasing doesn't strongly reflect hands-on, solution-making, or creative aspects central to the "building" pattern.  It leans more towards a strategic planning mindset which could fall under analytical.  The revised options better capture the potential "building" aspect by explicitly mentioning skill development or foundational work.  The psychological fit is high because the underlying idea of using one skillset (presumably analytical) to support another (creative, which aligns with the initial "passion") is a realistic approach for someone with a "building" mindset. They may think strategically about resources and pathways to achieve a larger creative goal.
- Suggested: ""Can I leverage my analytical skills to financially support my creative pursuits?"  or "I can build a strong foundation in one area to pursue my passion in another.""

**intro**
- Current: "Find the Station Keeper for guidance"
- Pattern: patience
- Issue: While finding a station keeper *could* involve patience, the text itself doesn't inherently reflect the thoughtful, reflective, and long-term aspects of the "patience" pattern.  The improved texts better capture the essence of methodical, persistent problem-solving which is more strongly aligned with patience as a thinking style.  A low accuracy score reflects this initial mismatch. A 6/10 in psychological fit implies a person with patience might indeed utilize this method but it's not definitively indicative of patience.
- Suggested: ""Seek methodical solutions to complex problems." or "Develop a step-by-step plan to address the challenge.""

**maya-pressure-discussion**
- Current: "Twenty years of their sacrifice is a lot of love to honor."
- Pattern: patience
- Issue: The original text hints at patience, but it's more focused on the *result* of patience (a large amount of love) rather than the process.  The revised options emphasize the sustained effort and commitment over time, which aligns more directly with the "thoughtful, reflective, long-term" aspects of the "patience" pattern.  The psychological fit is relatively high because someone with patience would likely appreciate the significance of long-term dedication.
- Suggested: ""Two decades of dedication deserves recognition." or "The consistent effort over twenty years shows deep commitment.""


### Choices Needing Pattern Change (10)
**samuel-first-meeting**
- Text: "My parents sent me here. They think I need direction."
- Current Pattern: helping
- Suggested Pattern: analytical
- Rationale: The text reveals a lack of self-direction and a reliance on external guidance (parents). This points more towards a need for analytical thinking to determine a suitable path, rather than a helping-oriented role.  A helping profession requires internal motivation and empathy, which aren't indicated here. The student is likely looking for a structured approach to career exploration, aligning with analytical thinking.  A low psychology score reflects the mismatch between the assigned pattern and the likely underlying need for structure and direction.

**healthcare-intro**
- Text: "Medical school is tough. How are you handling the pressure?"
- Current Pattern: helping
- Suggested Pattern: analytical
- Rationale: The text focuses on problem-solving ("How are you handling the pressure?") within a demanding context (medical school).  This aligns more with analytical thinking (logic, systematic thinking to manage stress and challenges) than with helping (which would involve emotional support or direct patient care). While a doctor ultimately helps people, this specific text snippet doesn't reflect that aspect of the profession.  The psychological fit is questionable because the helping pattern might lead someone to underestimate the intense analytical demands of medical school.

**maya-robotics-reveal**
- Text: "This could revolutionize medical training. You're brilliant."
- Current Pattern: helping
- Suggested Pattern: building
- Rationale: The text focuses on innovation and a revolutionary impact ("revolutionize," "brilliant").  This aligns strongly with the "building" pattern, which emphasizes creativity and solution-making. While a medical field *could* involve helping people, the statement itself doesn't highlight the empathetic or supportive aspects central to the "helping" pattern.  The "brilliant" comment suggests a focus on creating something new, not necessarily directly supporting individuals.

**samuel-first-meeting**
- Text: "I heard you help people find careers. I need something that actually pays."
- Current Pattern: analytical
- Suggested Pattern: helping
- Rationale: The text expresses a need for a career that is both helpful (helping people find careers) and financially rewarding.  The focus is on the impact on others and the practical aspect of earning a living, which aligns strongly with the "helping" pattern.  The "analytical" pattern doesn't fit because there's no mention of logic, data, or systematic thinking. While someone analytical *could* choose a well-paying career, the statement doesn't reflect that process.  The primary concern is the human element (helping) coupled with financial viability.

**samuel-first-meeting**
- Text: "Birmingham doesn't have opportunities for someone like me."
- Current Pattern: building
- Suggested Pattern: helping
- Rationale: The statement "Birmingham doesn't have opportunities for someone like me" expresses a feeling of lack of support or fit within a particular environment.  This aligns strongly with the "helping" pattern, which focuses on people and their needs. The "building" pattern emphasizes creation and solutions; this statement is more about a perceived lack of opportunity than about actively building something.  A person with a "building" mindset might be more likely to try to create opportunities rather than feel limited by their absence.  The low psychology score reflects that while possible, a "building" type might not express their frustration in this passive way.

**samuel-first-meeting**
- Text: "I don't feel brave. I feel like everyone else knows what they're doing except me."
- Current Pattern: patience
- Suggested Pattern: analytical
- Rationale: The statement "I don't feel brave. I feel like everyone else knows what they're doing except me" reflects self-doubt and a perceived lack of understanding.  This is not directly related to patience (thoughtful, reflective, long-term). It's more aligned with an analytical pattern, as the speaker is comparing themselves to others, suggesting a desire to understand their own position relative to a perceived standard (everyone else knowing what they're doing). The psychological fit for patience is high, because self-doubt can certainly accompany a patient approach, especially when learning something new, but the core sentiment is better captured by the analytical pattern.

**healthcare-intro**
- Text: "You seem conflicted about something. Want to talk?"
- Current Pattern: patience
- Suggested Pattern: helping
- Rationale: The text shows concern and offers support, which aligns strongly with the "helping" pattern's focus on people and empathy.  "Patience" implies a willingness to wait or endure, which isn't directly reflected in the offered help. While a patient person *might* say this, the core of the statement is about offering aid, not waiting.

**maya-robotics-reveal**
- Text: "What would happen if you showed this to your parents?"
- Current Pattern: patience
- Suggested Pattern: analytical
- Rationale: The text "What would happen if you showed this to your parents?" implies a consideration of potential consequences and reactions. This is more aligned with analytical thinking (predicting outcomes based on available information) than patience (which focuses on long-term perspective and thoughtful action).  While patience *might* be involved in how someone *responds* to the potential consequences, the core action of the text is analytical.  The psychological fit is low because someone highly patient might not even consider this question, whereas someone analytical might see it as a necessary step in a process.

**maya-family-love**
- Text: "Love that demands self-betrayal isn't really love."
- Current Pattern: challenging
- Suggested Pattern: insightful
- Rationale: The statement "Love that demands self-betrayal isn't really love" is insightful, not necessarily "challenging."  A challenging statement might provoke immediate conflict or resistance. This statement, while potentially uncomfortable, invites reflection and consideration of a concept.  The psychological fit is relatively high because insightful individuals often ponder profound concepts about relationships and human nature. Therefore, changing the pattern to "insightful" is the most accurate reflection of the text.

**maya-expectation-details**
- Text: "Whose life are you actually living?"
- Current Pattern: challenging
- Suggested Pattern: questioning
- Rationale: The text "Whose life are you actually living?" is a provocative question, designed to challenge assumptions and self-reflection.  While it might indirectly involve some analytical thought (analyzing one's life), the core function is to prompt questioning and self-examination, not to directly challenge something in a confrontational way.  A "challenging" pattern would imply more direct opposition or confrontation. The questioning pattern better fits the text's purpose.
