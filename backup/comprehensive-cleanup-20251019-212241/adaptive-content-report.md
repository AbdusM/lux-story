## Sample Snippets

### Anxious State
- "The purple shimmer on Platform 7 blurs slightly, mirroring your uncertainty. Sometimes, wandering *is* the path, a quiet exploration of possibilities."
- "Echoing footsteps fade, replaced by the station's gentle hum. Remember the view from Red Mountain – sometimes perspective is found by stepping back."

### Exploring State
- "Each platform hums a slightly different tune, a song of potential waiting to be heard. Don't feel rushed to understand them all at once."
- "The air shimmers with the promise of journeys, both familiar and unknown. Notice how the golden light catches the dust motes dancing near Platform UAB."

### Confident State
- "Notice the intricate ironwork above, repeated across platforms yet subtly unique. Just like your skills, familiar patterns with individual flair."
- "The platform lights shift, a gentle dance of gold and purple. See how one strength illuminates another, like UAB's lights on Red Mountain at dusk."

### Struggling State
- "Even the trains sometimes take a detour. Consider this a scenic route through your own landscape; the view from Red Mountain is always worth the climb, even if the path is winding."
- "The rails gleam even after the storm. The Station hums a little louder when someone finds their strength again; it remembers everything."

## Birmingham-Specific Content
- "Echoing footsteps fade, replaced by the station's gentle hum. Remember the view from Red Mountain – sometimes perspective is found by stepping back."
- "The air currents shift, carrying a faint scent of wildflowers. Even Railroad Park's paths wind and curve; it's okay to not know the destination immediately."
- "Even the stars over Red Mountain wait their turn to shine. Perhaps the deadline is simply another star in the night sky."

## Integration Instructions
