## Additional Context Notes

- The game has been transformed from a meditation app about a sloth

- Samuel's dialogue was just enhanced with train terminology
- Chapter 3 connects directly to Birmingham employers and programs
- The "clock in" ending removes all mysticism for practical action

Please be brutally honest. This is for a grant application where authenticity and practical value matter more than artistic merit. We need to know if this actually helps Birmingham youth or if it's too abstract/artistic to be useful.

**Grade inflation helps no one. Be critical.**
