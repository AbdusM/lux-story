# Grand Central Terminus - Narrative Bible

## World Rules

### The Nature of Grand Central Terminus

1. **Liminal Space**: Exists between the physical and metaphysical, between decision and action
2. **Temporal Fluidity**: Time moves based on emotional state and choices
3. **Responsive Architecture**: The station physically changes based on collective traveler energy
4. **The Midnight Rule**: Trains supposedly leave at midnight, but midnight is different for everyone
5. **Memory Echoes**: Strong emotions leave traces that sensitive travelers can perceive

### How the Station Works

- **Appears to those at crossroads** (career, life, identity)
- **Platforms represent potential paths**, not fixed destinations
- **Cannot be found intentionally** - only stumbled upon when needed
- **Exit changes you** - leaving through different doors leads to different futures
- **The Letter System** - mysterious letters guide some but not all travelers
