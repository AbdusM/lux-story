# Cognitive Load Assessment Framework
*For Interactive Narrative Games & Educational Software*

## Overview

This framework provides systematic methods for evaluating and optimizing cognitive load in interactive narrative games, particularly those targeting younger audiences (ages 9-13). Based on extensive analysis of educational game development and AAA design standards.

## Core Principles

### The 10-15 Second Rule
**Target age groups should be able to parse critical decisions within 10-15 seconds.**

This isn't just about reading speed‚Äîit's about the complete cognitive process:
1. **Parsing** the narrative context
2. **Understanding** available options  
3. **Evaluating** potential consequences
4. **Making** a confident decision

### Cognitive Load Categories

| Load Level | Score | Description | User Behavior |
|------------|-------|-------------|---------------|
| **Low (1-3)** | ‚úÖ Optimal | Binary choices, immediate feedback | Quick, confident decisions |
| **Medium (4-6)** | ‚ö†Ô∏è Caution | Multiple variables, some complexity | Thoughtful consideration |
| **High (7-10)** | ‚ùå Danger | Many simultaneous factors | Decision paralysis, frustration |

## Assessment Methodology

### Screen-by-Screen Analysis Template

#### 1. Information Priority Audit
For each interactive screen, categorize all visible elements:

**Primary (Must See):**
- Main narrative text
- Core choice options
- Immediate consequences

**Secondary (Helpful):**
- Resource costs/rewards
- Skill requirements
- Progress indicators

**Tertiary (Can be hidden):**
- Meta-information
- Abstract skill names
- Statistical details

#### 2. Eye Flow Mapping
Track where the user's attention moves:
- Does the eye follow a natural reading pattern?
- Are related elements visually grouped?
- How many "jumps" are required to assemble full information?

#### 3. Cognitive Load Scoring

**Evaluation Criteria:**

| Factor | Weight | Scoring Guidelines |
|--------|--------|-------------------|
| **Information Density** | 30% | Items visible simultaneously |
| **Decision Complexity** | 25% | Variables to consider per choice |
| **System Knowledge Required** | 20% | Unexplained concepts needed |
| **Time Pressure** | 15% | Urgency of decision |
| **Novel Concepts** | 10% | New mechanics introduced |

**Detailed Scoring Guide:**

### Information Density (30% weight)
- **1-2 points**: Single choice with clear outcome
- **3-4 points**: Multiple choices with simple consequences  
- **5-6 points**: Multiple information boxes appearing simultaneously
- **7-8 points**: Complex UI with scattered statistical information
- **9-10 points**: Information overload - multiple competing elements

### Decision Complexity (25% weight)
- **1-2 points**: Binary choice with obvious outcomes
- **3-4 points**: 3 choices with clear narrative differences
- **5-6 points**: Multiple variables to weigh (cost vs. reward)
- **7-8 points**: Complex resource management across multiple currencies
- **9-10 points**: Multi-dimensional optimization problem

### System Knowledge Required (20% weight)
- **1-2 points**: No prior system knowledge needed
- **3-4 points**: Basic understanding of introduced mechanics
- **5-6 points**: Familiarity with multiple game systems
- **7-8 points**: Complex interaction between systems
- **9-10 points**: Deep system mastery required

## Red Flag Indicators

### Immediate Action Required (Score 8-10)
- **The "Spreadsheet Feeling"**: Players calculating optimal choices instead of making narrative decisions
- **The "Frozen Player"**: Visible hesitation or confusion during observation
- **The "Random Click"**: Players clicking choices without reading due to overwhelm
- **The "Tutorial Trap"**: Complex systems introduced without sufficient explanation

### Warning Signs (Score 6-7)
- **The "Re-read Loop"**: Players reading the same information multiple times
- **The "Information Hunt"**: Eyes jumping around screen to find related information
- **The "Choice Paralysis"**: Extended decision time for simple narrative choices
- **The "System Confusion"**: Questions about what mechanics do or mean

---

## Age-Specific Guidelines

### Ages 9-11 (Elementary Focus)
**Maximum Acceptable Load: 5/10**

**Recommended Patterns:**
- Single resource system maximum
- Binary choices for story beats
- Immediate, visual feedback
- No abstract skill names

**Danger Zone:**
- More than 2 simultaneous variables
- Text longer than 2 sentences per choice
- Unexplained locked content

### Ages 12-13 (Middle School Transition)
**Maximum Acceptable Load: 7/10**

**Recommended Patterns:**
- Up to 2 resource systems
- 3-choice strategic decisions
- Delayed consequences with clear connection
- Simple skill progression

**Danger Zone:**
- Complex interdependent systems
- Abstract optimization problems
- Unclear failure states

## Testing Protocols

### The "Live Assessment" Method

#### Setup:
- Screen recording software
- Think-aloud protocol
- Target age participants
- Prepared scenarios

#### Key Metrics:
1. **Decision Time**: How long from choice appearance to selection?
2. **Re-reads**: How many times do they re-read information?
3. **Eye Movement**: Where do they look first, second, third?
4. **Verbalization**: What confusion do they express?
5. **Confidence**: Do they seem certain of their choice?

#### Scoring Rubric:

| Behavior | Score Modifier |
|----------|----------------|
| Decision in < 10 seconds | -1 point |
| Re-reads choice text | +1 point |
| Re-reads consequence info | +2 points |
| Asks clarifying questions | +2 points |
| Expresses uncertainty | +1 point |
| Changes mind after clicking | +3 points |

### The "Expert Review" Method

#### Checklist for Designers:

**Visual Hierarchy (Pass/Fail):**
- [ ] Most important information is largest/most prominent
- [ ] Related information is visually grouped
- [ ] Clear reading order established

**Information Architecture (0-10 scale):**
- [ ] All resources visible before spending
- [ ] Costs and benefits clearly paired with choices  
- [ ] No essential information requires prior knowledge

**System Complexity (Red/Yellow/Green):**
- **Green**: 1-2 systems, clear rules
- **Yellow**: 3 systems, some interaction
- **Red**: 4+ systems, complex interactions

## Optimization Strategies

### Quick Fixes (Low Effort, High Impact)

#### Visual Grouping
```
‚ùå SCATTERED:
[Choice Text]
... space ...
[Cost] [Reward] [Requirement] [Skill Name]

‚úÖ GROUPED:
[Choice Text]
‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê
‚îÇ Cost | Reward   ‚îÇ
‚îÇ Requirement     ‚îÇ  
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò
```

#### Information Reduction
- Hide tertiary information behind progressive disclosure
- Replace abstract names with functional descriptions
- Use icons to reduce text density

#### Context Provision
- Just-in-time tooltips for new concepts
- Visual connections between causes and effects
- Progressive complexity introduction

### Medium Fixes (Moderate Effort)

#### Tutorial Integration
```javascript
// Example: Just-in-time learning
if (isFirstTimeSeeing(mechanicType)) {
  showContextualTutorial({
    trigger: 'first-encounter',
    content: getExplanation(mechanicType),
    style: 'non-intrusive'
  });
}
```

#### Feedback Consolidation
Instead of multiple pop-ups, create single comprehensive feedback screens that group related rewards and consequences.

#### Progressive Disclosure
Start with simple choices, gradually introduce complexity as player demonstrates understanding.

### Major Overhauls (High Effort)

#### System Simplification
- Reduce number of simultaneous resources
- Consolidate similar mechanics
- Create clear system hierarchies

#### UI Redesign
- Implement scannable layouts
- Create consistent information patterns
- Establish clear visual language for different information types

## Case Study Examples

### High Cognitive Load Example (8/10)
**Screen**: Main choice with multiple resource costs

**Problems Identified:**
- Energy cost: -29
- Helper Points reward: +25  
- Skill requirement: Level 2
- Skill name: "Story Mapper"
- Three choices to compare

**Why It's High Load:**
- 4 different pieces of information per choice
- Abstract skill names require interpretation
- No visual grouping of related information
- Mathematical comparison required

**Optimization:**
```
BEFORE: Map patterns methodically [-29 Energy] [+25 Points] [Story Mapper] [Requires Level 2]

AFTER: Map patterns methodically
       ‚ö° Needs 29 energy | ‚≠ê Earn 25 points | üß† Logic skill grows
```

### Optimized Low Load Example (3/10)
**Screen**: Binary story choice

**Success Factors:**
- Two clear options
- Immediate emotional consequences obvious
- No resource management required
- Natural narrative progression

## Conclusion

Cognitive load management is not about "dumbing down" content‚Äîit's about **respecting the player's mental capacity** and **creating conditions for successful learning**. 

The goal is to challenge players appropriately while ensuring they never feel overwhelmed, confused, or abandoned by the design. When cognitive load is properly managed, players can focus on the aspects that matter most: making meaningful choices, engaging with the narrative, and developing the skills the game is designed to teach.

**Remember**: A confused player learns nothing. A confident player learns everything.

*This framework should be applied iteratively throughout development, not as a one-time assessment. Cognitive load optimization is an ongoing process that requires continuous attention to player experience and learning outcomes.*
