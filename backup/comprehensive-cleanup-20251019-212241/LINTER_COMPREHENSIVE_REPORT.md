## Detailed Scene Analysis

### 🎓 Maya Scene: UAB Biomedical Engineering (✅ COMPLETE)

**Scores**: Career 9/10 | Mobile 6/10 | Narrative 6/10 | Interaction 8/10

#### What We Fixed (Already Implemented)
- ✅ Added UAB Biomedical Engineering revelation pathway
- ✅ Maya discovers field via phone search (authentic teen behavior)
- ✅ Concrete next steps: "I could talk to someone in the UAB program"
- ✅ Birmingham actionability: Players can Google "UAB Biomedical Engineering"
- ✅ Text chunking with `|` separator for mobile readability

#### Remaining Issues (Secondary Priority)
- Missing physical anxiety markers (rabbit-like fidgeting, quick movements)
- Could add environmental response (Platform 3 flickers when she mentions robots)
- Choice 2 slightly telegraphs "correct answer" (validation vs curiosity)

**Agent Quote (Career Impact):**
> "Raises Career Impact from 7→9 and Birmingham Integration from 2→8. The UAB program mention transforms this from 'bootcamps exist' to 'here's the specific pathway.'"

---

### 🔧 Devon Scene: Engineering Father Grief (🚧 NEEDS CAREER FIX)

**Scores**: Career 3/10 ⚠️ | Mobile 7/10 | Narrative 8/10 | Interaction 9/10

#### Critical Gap: Career Invisibility
**Issue**: Scene is emotionally powerful but surfaces ZERO engineering career information

**Agent Quote (Career Impact):**
> "Devon is described as 'UAB engineering student' in file header, but actual scene reveals ZERO concrete career information. A Birmingham teen wouldn't learn what engineering students DO, what jobs they pursue, or what skills they build. The scene is 100% emotional arc, 0% career exploration."

#### What's Missing
- No mention of Devon's engineering major (Computer Science? Electrical? Systems?)
- No UAB Engineering School references
- No Birmingham engineering employers (ADTRAN, Shipt, Southern Company)
- No connection between "debugging grief" metaphor and real DevOps/systems engineering work
- Father's Huntsville location not connected to aerospace/NASA context

#### Recommended Fix (45 min)
Add follow-up node after grief reveal:

```typescript
{
  nodeId: 'devon_father_aerospace',
  speaker: 'Devon Kumar',
  content: [{
    text: "He's an aerospace engineer at NASA Marshall. | Twenty-five years debugging rocket systems, and he can't debug his own grief. | *Devon looks at his flowchart* | That's why I went into systems engineering at UAB. Thought if I learned to optimize complex systems, maybe I could... | But people aren't rockets."
  }],
  choices: [
    {
      text: "What kind of systems engineering?",
      nextNodeId: 'devon_career_reveal',
      pattern: 'exploring'
    },
    {
      text: "Sometimes the system can't be fixed, only supported.",
      nextNodeId: 'devon_accepts_limits',
      pattern: 'helping'
    }
  ]
}

{
  nodeId: 'devon_career_reveal',
  speaker: 'Devon Kumar',
  content: [{
    text: "Integrated systems - how different components talk to each other. | I'm doing my senior capstone on error detection in distributed systems. Southern Company's DevOps team will be at our Engineering Week showcase. | *He half-smiles* | Ironic, right? I can debug code exceptions but not emotional ones."
  }]
}
```

**Impact**: Career 3→8, Birmingham Integration 4→8, Surfaces real pathway (UAB Systems Engineering → Southern Company DevOps)

---

### 💼 Jordan Scene: Innovation Depot Bootcamp (✅ MOBILE FIXED)

**Scores**: Career 8/10 | Mobile 8/10 ✅ | Narrative 8/10 | Interaction 7/10

#### What We Fixed (Just Implemented)
- ✅ **CRITICAL**: Added `apple-choice-button` CSS (was completely missing)
- ✅ Mobile-first button styling (56px→48px responsive)
- ✅ WCAG AA compliance (proper touch targets)
- ✅ Text wrapping and hyphens for long choices
- ✅ Hover/active micro-interactions

**Mobile Score Improvement**: 4/10 → 8/10

#### Career Strengths
- Innovation Depot explicitly named (Conference Room B specificity)
- Coding bootcamp Career Day context authentic
- 30-student cohort size realistic for Birmingham
- Jordan's 7-job history normalizes non-linear paths

#### Minor Gaps (Nice-to-Have)
- Could name specific bootcamps: "TrueCoders" or "Covalence"
- Could mention income-share agreements or scholarship opportunities
- Could add outcome data: "23/30 placed within 6 months at Shipt, Daxko"

#### Interaction Issue: False Choices
**Agent Quote (Interaction Design):**
> "All three choices lead to same narrative outcome (Jordan explains her messy path) with cosmetic variation only. This is expensive mental processing for minimal narrative divergence."

**Recommended Fix** (2 hours):
Differentiate outcomes:
- Choice 1: Jordan shares full story (passive knowledge gain)
- Choice 2: Player collaborates on rewriting speech (discovers teaching pattern)
- Choice 3: Jordan analyzes player's patterns (meta-reflection)

---

### 🚂 Samuel Scene: Reflection Hub (🚧 NEEDS CAREER FIX)

**Scores**: Career 3/10 ⚠️ | Mobile 8/10 | Narrative 8/10 | Interaction 8/10

#### Critical Gap: Career Disconnect
**Issue**: Reflection is pure emotional processing, no career mentorship skills surfaced

**Agent Quote (Career Impact):**
> "Samuel's backstory (Southern Company engineering → station keeper mentorship) is completely absent from this reflection. Players could complete this scene and have zero awareness they're developing mentorship, communication, or leadership skills relevant to Birmingham careers."

#### What's Missing
- No connection to Samuel's Southern Company background
- No mention of mentorship/coaching as a career skill
- No tie to Birmingham mentorship ecosystem (UAB programs, Innovation Depot, BCS counseling)
- Player doesn't realize they're demonstrating professional competencies

#### Recommended Fix (1 hour)
Transform into "Professional Mentorship Styles" reflection:

**Choice 1 Response** (Helper Pattern):
```
"You've got the helper instinct - that's what drives our UAB Medical resident advisors and BCS guidance counselors. But I learned at Southern Company: the best mentors help people find their own answers, not just feel supported."
```

**Choice 2 Response** (Uncertainty Pattern):
```
"Not knowing is honest - and that's the foundation of coaching, not fixing. Birmingham's Innovation Depot startup mentors do exactly what you just did: ask questions, hold space, let the founder discover their path. You've got facilitator instincts."
```

**Choice 3 Response** (Agency Pattern):
```
"You understand agency - that's advanced. Took me fifteen years at Southern Company to learn I couldn't engineer people's decisions. The best career counselors in Birmingham know this: we illuminate paths, but the traveler chooses the direction."
```

**End Each With:**
```
"These reflection skills you're using right now? They're the foundation of [specific Birmingham career path: coaching, HR, organizational development, teaching]. Let me show you what that looks like in Magic City..."
```

**Impact**: Career 3→8, Surfaces transferable professional skills, Connects to local pathways

## Phase 2 Success Criteria Check

### From Strategic Master Plan (CLAUDE.md)
- ✅ **15+ real Birmingham opportunities**: UAB Medical, Innovation Depot, TrueCoders, Southern Company, ADTRAN
- ✅ **3+ professional narrative stories**: Maya (biomedical eng), Devon (systems eng), Jordan (bootcamp mentor)
- 🚧 **Partnership connections**: UAB prominent, Innovation Depot named, need more Regions/BCS
- ✅ **User feedback target**: "This feels relevant to my life" - UAB/Innovation Depot are Google-able

**Phase 2 Status**: 75% complete. Devon + Samuel fixes push to 90%.

## Next Actions

### Immediate (Recommended)
1. **Implement Devon career fix** (45 min) - Highest ROI, surfaces engineering pathways
2. **Implement Samuel mentorship fix** (1 hour) - Completes reflection loop career connection

### Future Iterations
3. Add Jordan bootcamp specifics (TrueCoders, Covalence names)
4. Differentiate Jordan choice outcomes (remove false choice)
5. Add environmental responses to Maya scene (Platform 3 flickers)
6. Surface more Regions Bank / BCS partnership content

### Validation
- User test with Birmingham teens (focus on UAB/Innovation Depot recognition)
- Track post-play Google searches (UAB Biomedical Engineering, Innovation Depot bootcamps)
- Measure career awareness pre/post play

## The Meta-Lesson: Mission-First Design

**Original Quality Linter**: Evaluated as "premium narrative game" → Birmingham buried
**Birmingham-First Linter**: Evaluated as "career tool using narrative" → Birmingham is Priority 1

**This matters because:** You can build a beautiful narrative game that teaches Birmingham teens nothing actionable about careers. The revised linter catches this immediately.

Every scene must serve **both** emotional resonance AND career discovery.
