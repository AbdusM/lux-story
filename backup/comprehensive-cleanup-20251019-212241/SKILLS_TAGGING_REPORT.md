## Examples of Well-Tagged Choices

### 1. Maya - Family Pressure Response
```typescript
{
  choiceId: 'family_understanding',
  text: "What if they sacrificed for your happiness, not just a title?",
  nextNodeId: 'maya_reframes_sacrifice',
  pattern: 'patience',
  skills: ['emotional_intelligence', 'cultural_competence', 'critical_thinking'],
  // Bridges opposing ideas (parents' dreams vs Maya's) with cultural sensitivity
}
```

### 2. Devon - Empathy Reframe
```typescript
{
  choiceId: 'reframe_empathy',
  text: "Maybe empathy IS a kind of data.",
  nextNodeId: 'devon_reframe',
  pattern: 'helping',
  skills: ['creativity', 'critical_thinking', 'emotional_intelligence'],
  // Novel connection between logic and emotion - creative problem-solving
}
```

### 3. Jordan - Impostor Syndrome Challenge
```typescript
{
  choiceId: 'jordan_impostor_ask_real',
  text: "What would you tell those students if you believed your story was real?",
  nextNodeId: 'jordan_crossroads',
  pattern: 'exploring',
  skills: ['creativity', 'critical_thinking', 'communication'],
  // Reframes narrative, encourages self-reflection, guides expression
}
```

### 4. Samuel - Reflection on Agency
```typescript
{
  choiceId: 'skip_reflection',
  text: "She made her own choice.",
  nextNodeId: 'samuel_reflect_on_agency',
  pattern: 'patience',
  skills: ['critical_thinking', 'emotional_intelligence'],
  // Recognizes autonomy vs savior complex - sophisticated insight
}
```

### 5. Maya - Hybrid Path Discovery
```typescript
{
  choiceId: 'hint_question',
  text: "What if there's a field that combines both?",
  nextNodeId: 'maya_uab_revelation',
  pattern: 'helping',
  skills: ['creativity', 'problem_solving', 'critical_thinking'],
  // Bridging medicine and robotics - creative problem-solving
}
```

## Tagging Strategy

### Skill Assignment Logic

1. **Critical Thinking**: Analyzing arguments, evaluating options, identifying patterns, bridging opposing ideas
   - Example: "You're doing what he does - trying to debug systems" (Devon)

2. **Creativity**: Novel connections, reframing problems, finding third options
   - Example: "What if there's a field that combines both?" (Maya)

3. **Emotional Intelligence**: Reading emotions, empathy, self-awareness, understanding others
   - Example: "Maybe feelings aren't bugs to fix?" (Devon)

4. **Communication**: Expressing ideas clearly, asking powerful questions, active listening
   - Example: "What would you tell those students if you believed your story was real?" (Jordan)

5. **Problem Solving**: Finding practical solutions, systematic thinking, actionable pathways
   - Example: "Have you thought about medical robotics?" (Maya)

6. **Leadership**: Guiding others, giving permission, inspiring action
   - Example: "Whatever you choose, I believe in you" (Maya crossroads)

7. **Adaptability**: Flexibility, openness to change, handling uncertainty
   - Example: "I'm not sure what I actually did" (Samuel reflection)

8. **Cultural Competence**: Cross-cultural understanding, honoring diverse values
   - Example: "What if they sacrificed for your happiness, not just a title?" (Maya)

### Choices NOT Tagged

Avoided tagging:
- Simple navigation choices ("Continue", "Ask about X")
- Choices with only surface-level engagement
- Choices that don't demonstrate clear cognitive/emotional patterns
- Ending/transition choices with no skill demonstration

## Technical Implementation

### Type Safety
```typescript
// Added to ConditionalChoice interface
skills?: Array<
  'critical_thinking' | 'creativity' | 'communication' | 'collaboration' |
  'adaptability' | 'leadership' | 'digital_literacy' | 'emotional_intelligence' |
  'cultural_competence' | 'problem_solving' | 'time_management' | 'financial_literacy'
>
```

### Compilation Status
✅ All changes compile successfully
❌ Pre-existing TypeScript errors (unrelated to skills tagging)

## Next Steps for Samuel Enhancement

1. **Week 2 Day 1 Task 2**: Create skill accumulation tracker
   - Track which skills player demonstrates across all choices
   - Build player skill profile: `{ critical_thinking: 5, creativity: 3, ... }`

2. **Week 2 Day 1 Task 3**: Generate Samuel's personalized observations
   - "You have a gift for seeing what others miss" (creativity + critical_thinking)
   - "Your questions help people find their own answers" (communication + emotional_intelligence)
   - "You bridge opposing ideas without forcing resolution" (critical_thinking + adaptability)

3. **Integration Point**: Feed skill profile to Samuel's dialogue generation
   - Condition: `if (skills.creativity >= 3 && skills.critical_thinking >= 3)`
   - Samuel: "You see connections others miss. That's not luck - that's pattern recognition."

## Quality Assurance

### Coverage
- ✅ All major character arcs covered (Maya, Devon, Samuel, Jordan)
- ✅ Key emotional/cognitive moments tagged
- ✅ Crossroads decisions tagged
- ✅ Bridge/reframe moments tagged
- ✅ Challenging/supporting moments tagged

### Balance
- ✅ Mix of all major skills (8 of 12 WEF skills represented)
- ✅ 1-3 skills per choice (not overwhelming)
- ✅ Skills match actual cognitive/emotional pattern of choice

### Future Additions
- **Collaboration**: When multi-character scenes added
- **Digital Literacy**: If tech-focused career paths expanded
- **Time Management**: If urgency/pacing mechanics integrated
- **Financial Literacy**: If economic decision points added

## Conclusion

Successfully implemented Week 2 Day 1 Task 1. The dialogue graph now has rich metadata that enables Samuel to deliver eerily personalized observations based on the player's demonstrated 2030 skills patterns. Zero user-facing UI changes - all feedback will be delivered through Samuel's narrative voice.
