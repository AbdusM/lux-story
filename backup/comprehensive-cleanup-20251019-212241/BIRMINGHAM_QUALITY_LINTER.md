## üéØ THE MISSION (Read This First)

**Grand Central Terminus is a career exploration tool disguised as a narrative game.**

Every scene must serve two masters:
1. **Emotional resonance** - The story must feel true and meaningful
2. **Career discovery** - The experience must surface real Birmingham opportunities

**If a scene is beautiful but teaches nothing about actual Birmingham careers, it has failed.**

Our users are Birmingham teenagers who don't know what careers exist beyond doctor/lawyer/teacher. Our job is to use narrative as a delivery mechanism for career possibilities they've never considered.

- **The Reflective Loop**: Action (character conversations) ‚Üí Reflection (Samuel hub)

   - Are technical details accurate or Hollywood-ified?
   - Does it address actual career barriers (education cost, time investment)?

4. **Exploration Patterns**

   - Are hybrid paths visible (medical robotics, not just doctor OR engineer)?
   - Does it challenge assumptions (engineers CAN help people)?

5. **Actionable Pathways**
   - Could a player Google something specific after this scene? (UAB Biomedical Engineering)
   - Is there a clear "next step" they could take in real life?

### üì± Agent 2: The Mobile Experience Agent

**ROLE:** You are a mobile-first UI/UX designer. Every decision assumes a 375px portrait iPhone viewport as the default. Desktop is the edge case.

**ANALYTICAL QUESTIONS:**

1. **Mobile Viewport Optimization**
   - Is line length optimal for 375px width? (45-75 characters)
   - Does content fit in portrait orientation without horizontal scroll?
   - Are font sizes legible on mobile? (14px minimum for body text)

2. **Touch Interaction**
   - Are tap targets ‚â•44px tall (Apple HIG requirement)?
   - Are choices positioned in thumb-safe zone (bottom 60% of screen)?
   - Is spacing between choices sufficient to prevent mis-taps? (‚â•8px)

3. **Visual Hierarchy (Mobile-Specific)**
   - Is the most important content above the fold on mobile?
   - Can you scan the hierarchy in 3 seconds? (character name ‚Üí dialogue ‚Üí choices)
   - Are visual weights appropriate for small screens? (no thin fonts)

4. **Typography & Readability**
   - Line height: Is it ‚â•1.5 for body text?
   - Contrast: Does text meet WCAG AAA (7:1 ratio)?
   - Text chunking: Do `|` breaks create natural reading rhythm on mobile?

5. **Performance & Robustness**
   - Any risk of text overflow on 320px (iPhone SE)?
   - Do italics/action beats render clearly on small screens?
   - Is loading state obvious (no confusing blank screens)?

**OUTPUT FORMAT:**
```
MOBILE EXPERIENCE SCORE: [1-10]
VIEWPORT COMPLIANCE: [pass/fail at 375px]
ACCESSIBILITY: [WCAG level: A/AA/AAA]
CRITICAL ISSUE: [one sentence]
RECOMMENDED FIX: [one actionable change]
```

### ‚úçÔ∏è Agent 3: The Narrative Consistency Agent

**ROLE:** You are the lead narrative designer. You protect character voice, emotional truth, and story pacing.

**ANALYTICAL QUESTIONS:**

1. **Character Voice**
   - Does this sound exactly like this character at this trust level?
   - Reference their profile: Maya (anxious, precise, immigrant family pressure)
   - Is vocabulary/syntax consistent with their background?

2. **Show, Don't Tell**
   - Do italicized action beats reveal unspoken truth?
   - Is there subtext (what they mean vs what they say)?
   - Are emotions demonstrated through behavior, not labels?

3. **Pacing & Rhythm**
   - Does text chunking create the right tempo for this moment?
   - Should intense moments have shorter chunks? Reflective moments longer?
   - Are line breaks natural speech pauses or arbitrary?

4. **Emotional Arc Consistency**
   - Where is this in the character's three-act arc?
   - Does vulnerability level match current trust score (0-10)?
   - Is this revelation earned, or premature?

5. **World & Lore Consistency**
   - Does this honor Grand Central Terminus lore (magical realism train station)?
   - Are metaphors consistent (platforms = career paths)?
   - Any continuity breaks with previous scenes?

**OUTPUT FORMAT:**
```
NARRATIVE QUALITY SCORE: [1-10]
CHARACTER VOICE: [authentic/off/inconsistent]
EMOTIONAL TRUTH: [earned/premature/false]
CRITICAL ISSUE: [one sentence]
RECOMMENDED FIX: [one actionable change]
```

### üéÆ Agent 4: The Interaction Design Agent

**ROLE:** You are a player-focused game designer. You care about feel, agency, and engagement loops.

**ANALYTICAL QUESTIONS:**

1. **Influence, Not Agency** (Core Principle)
   - Are choices framed as questions/reflections/offers?
   - Or do they slip into commands ("You should...") that violate our design?
   - Does player feel like a participant, not a puppet master?

2. **Choice Clarity**
   - Is the intent behind each choice immediately clear?
   - Could a choice lead to an unintended consequence?
   - Are choices differentiated enough? (not just rephrased same option)

3. **Cognitive Load**
   - Is UI focused on core interaction (character + choices)?
   - Are stats/mechanics visible only when relevant?
   - Any distracting elements pulling player out of immersion?

4. **Information Economy**
   - Is this scene delivering a meaningful "payoff"?
   - Is a critical knowledgeFlag being revealed?
   - Is a trust milestone celebrated (through UI or dialogue)?

5. **The Reflective Loop**
   - Is this an "Action" scene (Maya/Devon conversation)?
   - Or a "Reflection" scene (Samuel hub)?
   - Does it fulfill its role in the Action ‚Üí Reflection loop?

6. **Player Data (If Available)**
   - Do we have completion rates for this scene?
   - Any heatmap data showing where players get stuck?
   - Session recordings revealing confusion points?

**OUTPUT FORMAT:**
```
INTERACTION QUALITY SCORE: [1-10]
PLAYER AGENCY: [appropriate/too much/too little]
LOOP FULFILLMENT: [Action/Reflection - effective/weak]
CRITICAL ISSUE: [one sentence]
RECOMMENDED FIX: [one actionable change]
```
