## Example 1: Helper Profile (Emotional Intelligence + Communication)

### Player Persona Data

```typescript
{
  playerId: 'user_12345',
  dominantPatterns: ['helping', 'patience'],
  patternCounts: { helping: 8, patience: 5, analytical: 2 },
  topSkills: [
    {
      skill: 'emotional_intelligence',
      count: 6,
      percentage: 40
    },
    {
      skill: 'communication',
      count: 4,
      percentage: 27
    },
    {
      skill: 'adaptability',
      count: 3,
      percentage: 20
    }
  ],
  skillDemonstrations: {
    emotional_intelligence: {
      count: 6,
      latestContext: 'When Devon struggled with his father\'s grief, they said "That must have hurt" - validating pain without rushing to fix it. This demonstrates rare emotional maturity and ability to sit with discomfort.',
      latestScene: 'devon_emotional_breakthrough',
      timestamp: 1735689600000
    },
    communication: {
      count: 4,
      latestContext: 'Their response "What about my own path?" to Samuel shows vulnerability and directness, creating authentic dialogue that builds trust through honest self-reflection.',
      latestScene: 'samuel_wisdom_validation',
      timestamp: 1735689200000
    }
  },
  socialOrientation: 'helper',
  problemApproach: 'intuitive',
  responseSpeed: 'moderate'
}
```

### Generated Samuel Dialogue

```
"I watched how you helped Maya see bridges where others see walls. That kind of thinking -
finding integration instead of either/or - it's what makes Platform 7½ appear for some travelers.

You're seeing what people need before they ask for it. Devon needed confidence in his systems thinking.
Maya needed permission to dream differently. That's rare. Healthcare? Teaching? Both need that ability
to meet people in their uncertainty without rushing to fix them.

The station doesn't call people who have all the answers. It calls people who know how to sit with questions."
```

**Emotion:** `knowing`
**Confidence:** `0.95`
**Career Connections:** Healthcare, Teaching, Counseling

**Analysis:**
- ✅ References specific context: "Maya see bridges where others see walls"
- ✅ No explicit skill naming
- ✅ Connects pattern to career paths naturally
- ✅ Maintains Samuel's warm, observant voice
- ✅ 2-4 sentence structure (extended to 3 for depth)

## Example 2: Analyzer Profile (Critical Thinking + Problem Solving)

### Player Persona Data

```typescript
{
  playerId: 'user_67890',
  dominantPatterns: ['analytical', 'building'],
  patternCounts: { analytical: 9, building: 4, helping: 2 },
  topSkills: [
    {
      skill: 'critical_thinking',
      count: 7,
      percentage: 47
    },
    {
      skill: 'problem_solving',
      count: 5,
      percentage: 33
    },
    {
      skill: 'creativity',
      count: 2,
      percentage: 13
    }
  ],
  skillDemonstrations: {
    critical_thinking: {
      count: 7,
      latestContext: 'Recognized the false binary in Devon\'s thinking ("Logic OR emotion. What about both?"), demonstrating systems thinking that embraces complexity rather than forcing simple either/or choices.',
      latestScene: 'devon_crossroads_integrated',
      timestamp: 1735690000000
    },
    problem_solving: {
      count: 5,
      latestContext: 'Helped Maya see that biomedical engineering bridges both her passion for robotics and family expectations for medicine - creating third options where others see only two paths.',
      latestScene: 'maya_uab_bridge',
      timestamp: 1735689800000
    }
  },
  socialOrientation: 'independent',
  problemApproach: 'analytical',
  responseSpeed: 'deliberate'
}
```

### Generated Samuel Dialogue

```
"I notice you don't accept the first answer someone gives you. When Devon said it's 'logic or emotion,'
you saw the false choice. When Maya said it's 'doctor or disappointment,' you found the bridge.

That pattern - seeing systems where others see binaries - it's what Birmingham's Innovation Depot looks
for in their startup advisors. Data analysts who understand human systems, not just numbers.

Most people want to simplify complexity. You're mapping it. That's a different kind of valuable."
```

**Emotion:** `reflective`
**Confidence:** `0.93`
**Career Connections:** Data Analysis, Systems Thinking, Innovation/Startups

**Analysis:**
- ✅ References two specific contexts: Devon's binary + Maya's bridge
- ✅ Shows observation without naming skills
- ✅ Connects to Birmingham-specific opportunity (Innovation Depot)
- ✅ Career path integration feels natural
- ✅ Maintains analytical respect in Samuel's tone

## Example 3: Explorer Profile (Creativity + Adaptability)

### Player Persona Data

```typescript
{
  playerId: 'user_abcde',
  dominantPatterns: ['exploring', 'building', 'patience'],
  patternCounts: { exploring: 7, building: 5, patience: 3 },
  topSkills: [
    {
      skill: 'creativity',
      count: 6,
      percentage: 40

      timestamp: 1735690400000
    },
    adaptability: {
      count: 5,
      latestContext: 'Explored three different platforms (Care Line, Builder\'s Track, Data Stream) in one session, building connections across different career paths rather than committing to single narrow direction.',
      latestScene: 'platform_comprehensive_exploration',
      timestamp: 1735690200000
    }
  },
  socialOrientation: 'collaborator',
  problemApproach: 'creative',
  responseSpeed: 'quick'
}
```

### Generated Samuel Dialogue

```
"Three platforms in one night. Some travelers call that indecision. I call it thorough exploration.

You helped Jordan see seven jobs as seven teachers - turned what felt like failure into accumulated wisdom.
That reframing? That's the kind of creativity Birmingham's reinvented itself with for decades.
From steel mills to medical research, from railroads to tech hubs.

The best career paths often emerge from unexpected combinations. You're not scattered. You're mapping possibilities."
```

**Emotion:** `warm`
**Confidence:** `0.91`
**Career Connections:** Innovation, Interdisciplinary fields, Birmingham transformation narrative

**Analysis:**
- ✅ References platform exploration pattern
- ✅ Highlights Jordan narrative reframe specifically
- ✅ Connects to Birmingham's transformation story
- ✅ Reframes "indecision" as "thorough exploration"
- ✅ Validates exploratory approach as valuable
