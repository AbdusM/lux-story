# System Status: Career Exploration Platform

## ✅ Current Status: OPERATIONAL

All systems are functioning correctly after resolving the infinite loop issue.

## Fixed Issues

### Maximum Update Depth Exceeded
**Problem:** Infinite loop in useEffect due to function recreation on every render
**Solution:** 
- Changed performanceSystem from useState to useMemo
- Wrapped all functions in useAdaptiveNarrative with useCallback
- Proper dependency arrays throughout

## System Components Working

### 1. Performance Equation
```
Performance = (Alignment × Consistency) + (Learning × Patience) - (Anxiety × Rushing)
```
- ✅ Tracking all 6 metrics invisibly
- ✅ Calculating performance levels correctly
- ✅ Storing in localStorage

### 2. Adaptive Systems
- ✅ Narrative adaptations based on performance
- ✅ Visual feedback through CSS classes
- ✅ Breathing invitation frequency adjustment
- ✅ Ambient messages matching player state

### 3. Career Discovery
- ✅ Theme tracking through choices
- ✅ Pattern recognition
- ✅ Natural emergence without forced pathways
- ✅ Birmingham-specific content integrated

## Testing Status

### Browser Testing
- ✅ No console errors
- ✅ Build completes successfully
- ✅ TypeScript compilation passes
- ✅ Application loads and runs

### Performance Testing
Test with different play styles:
1. **Anxious** (rush choices) → System provides calming
2. **Patient** (wait 15+ seconds) → System encourages exploration
3. **Consistent** (same themes) → System affirms direction

## Deployment Ready

### Production URLs
- Main branch: `lux-story.pages.dev`
- Career branch: Ready for deployment

### Grant Demo Ready
- Performance equation working
- Adaptive systems responding
- Career patterns emerging naturally
- No visible metrics or gamification

## Next Steps

1. Deploy to production
2. Test with Birmingham youth
3. Gather performance data
4. Present to grant committee
