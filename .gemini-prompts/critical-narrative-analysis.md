## Analysis Framework

### 1. CHARACTER DEPTH ANALYSIS

For EACH character (Marcus, Tess, Yaquin, Maya, Devon, Jordan, Samuel), evaluate:

**A. Backstory Coherence**
- Does their past justify their present beliefs and behaviors?

- Do their motivations make psychological sense?
- Is there sufficient emotional depth?
- **CRITICAL**: Where does the backstory feel contrived or convenient for the plot?

**B. Voice Consistency**
- Does each character have a distinct verbal pattern?
- Are there moments where characters sound identical?
- Do they use vocabulary/syntax appropriate to their background?
- **CRITICAL**: Where do characters break voice or sound like the author?

**C. Emotional Range**
- Do characters exhibit genuine emotional complexity?
- Are they allowed to be contradictory, flawed, uncertain?
- Do they have moments of vulnerability AND strength?

- Are there satisfying resolution paths?
- **CRITICAL**: Where do arcs feel predictable or shallow?

---

### 2. DIALOGUE QUALITY ANALYSIS

For EACH dialogue graph (all 7 character arcs), evaluate:

**A. Natural Speech Patterns**
- Does dialogue sound like how people actually talk?
- Are there moments of awkward exposition?
- Do characters reveal information organically?
- **CRITICAL**: Identify every line that feels "written" rather than "spoken"

**B. Subtext and Implication**
- Are characters saying what they mean or hinting at deeper truths?
- Is there meaningful tension between words and emotion?

- Are there appropriate pauses, interruptions, hesitations?
- Does dialogue length match emotional intensity?
- **CRITICAL**: Where does pacing drag or feel rushed?

**D. Player Agency Integration**
- Do player choices meaningfully shape conversation direction?
- Are choices truly distinct or cosmetically different?

### 3. EDUCATIONAL INTEGRATION ANALYSIS

**A. Skills Framework Authenticity**
- Are WEF 2030 skills demonstrated naturally in context?
- Do skill reveals feel forced or organic?
- Is the pedagogical intent invisible or heavy-handed?
- **CRITICAL**: Where does "teaching" compromise storytelling?

**B. Learning Objectives Clarity**
- Can players actually learn about these careers authentically?
- Are technical details accurate and current?
- Do characters embody their professions credibly?
- **CRITICAL**: Where does career education feel superficial or stereotypical?

**C. Pattern Recognition Design**
- Do player choice patterns (analytical, helping, building, etc.) emerge naturally?
- Are patterns reinforced without being obvious?
- Do reflections feel earned or patronizing?
- **CRITICAL**: Where does the system feel gamified rather than authentic?

---

### 4. NARRATIVE SYSTEMS ANALYSIS

**A. Branching Effectiveness**
- Do branches create meaningfully different experiences?
- Are there dead-end paths or converging rails?

- **CRITICAL**: Where does branching fail to deliver on its promise?

**B. State Management**
- Does the game remember and acknowledge player history?
- Are there continuity errors across scenes?
- Do flags and conditions make narrative sense?
- **CRITICAL**: Where does state tracking break immersion?

**C. Consequence Design**
- Do choices have visible, meaningful consequences?
- Are consequences telegraphed or surprising?
- Is there satisfying cause-and-effect?
- **CRITICAL**: Where do consequences feel arbitrary or absent?

---

### 5. SPECIFIC WEAKNESSES TO IDENTIFY

**Flag these issues mercilessly:**

1. **Purple Prose**: Overly literary or flowery language that breaks character voice
2. **Info Dumping**: Unnatural exposition that feels like a lecture
3. **False Choices**: Options that lead to identical outcomes
4. **Character Inconsistency**: Behavior that contradicts established traits
5. **Motivation Gaps**: Actions without clear psychological drivers
6. **Convenient Plot Devices**: Contrived situations that serve story over realism
7. **Missing Reactions**: Characters not responding to major revelations
8. **Emotional Whiplash**: Rapid mood shifts without justification
9. **Stereotyping**: Reliance on career/demographic clichés
10. **Missed Opportunities**: Scenes that could be deeper, richer, more complex

---

### 6. COMPARATIVE BENCHMARKING

**Compare this narrative to:**

- **The Last of Us Part II**: Character complexity, moral ambiguity
- **Disco Elysium**: Voice distinctiveness, philosophical depth
- **Life is Strange**: Choice consequence, emotional authenticity
- **80 Days**: Educational content integration, replayability
- **Firewatch**: Natural dialogue, environmental storytelling

**Ask:**
- Where does this game fall short of these benchmarks?
- What specific techniques from these games are missing?
- How can each character arc reach that level of quality?

### 8. ANALYSIS INSTRUCTIONS

**DO:**
- Be brutally honest - this is a professional critique, not feedback for a beginner
- Cite specific dialogue lines and scenes by nodeId
- Compare dialogue to real-world speech patterns
- Question every narrative choice
- Identify patterns of weakness across characters
- Suggest concrete improvements with examples
- Prioritize issues by impact on player experience

**DON'T:**
- Praise without critique - assume everything can be better
- Be vague - "dialogue feels off" is useless; "Marcus uses medical jargon inconsistently in nodes X, Y, Z" is helpful
- Accept mediocrity - this aims to be world-class
- Ignore educational goals - they must enhance, not compromise, storytelling
- Forget player perspective - analyze as a player would experience it

---

### 9. FOCUS AREAS BY CHARACTER

**Marcus (ECMO Specialist)**
- Does the medical simulation feel authentic or gimmicky?
- Is his "weight of life-support" conflict emotionally resonant?
- Does his technical expertise enhance or obscure character?

**Tess (Crisis Management Coordinator)**
- Is the flooding crisis scenario believable and urgent?
- Does her decision-making framework feel like real training or a game mechanic?
- Are her ethical dilemmas genuinely difficult?

**Yaquin (Urban Planner)**
- Does his vision for community design feel inspired or generic?
- Is his conflict between idealism and pragmatism authentic?
- Does dialogue avoid urban planning clichés?

**Maya** (Character details needed for analysis)
- What's her core conflict?
- How does she differ from other characters?
- What career does she represent?

**Devon** (Character details needed for analysis)
- What's unique about their voice?
- What educational content do they deliver?
- How do they challenge the player?

**Jordan** (Career Counselor?)
- Does meta-narrative framing work or feel forced?
- Is guidance helpful or patronizing?
- How does Jordan evolve beyond facilitator role?

**Samuel** (Hub Character)
- Does he have depth beyond being a connector?
- Is there a meaningful relationship arc?
- What's his personal journey?

---

### 10. FINAL DIRECTIVE

**Your mission:**
Tear this narrative apart. Find every crack, every weakness, every missed opportunity. Don't hold back. This game aims to be EXCEPTIONAL - mediocre feedback produces mediocre results.

**Assume:**
- The writers can handle harsh critique
- Every character can be 3x better
- Every dialogue line can be sharper
- Every choice can matter more
- The educational content can be seamlessly invisible

**Deliver:**
A report so thorough and critical that implementing 50% of recommendations would dramatically elevate the entire experience.

**Length:**
Minimum 5,000 words. This is comprehensive analysis, not surface-level review.

**Tone:**
Professional, specific, uncompromising. Like a script doctor being paid $50,000 to save a troubled production.

## Begin Analysis

Start with Marcus (most developed), then Tess, then Yaquin. For each:

1. Read the ENTIRE dialogue graph
2. Note every weakness, gap, inconsistency
3. Compare to benchmark games
4. Provide specific rewrites for worst offenders
5. Rate overall quality

Then synthesize findings into comprehensive report as specified above.

**Remember:** Your job is to make this GREAT, not comfortable. Be ruthless.
